<p><i>Consider what you have in the smallest
chosen library. A company of the wisest and
wittiest men that could be picked out of all civil
countries, in a thousand years, have set in best
order the results of their learning and wisdom.
The men themselves were hidden and inaccessible,
solitary, impatient of interruption, fenced
by etiquette; but the thought that they did not
uncover to their bosom friend is here written
out in transparent words to us, the strangers
of another age. We owe to books those general
benefits which come from high intellectual action.
Thus, I think, we often owe to them the
perception of immortality. They impart sympathetic
activity to the moral power. Go with
mean people, and you think life is mean. Then
read Plutarch, and the world is a proud
place, peopled with men of positive quality,
with heroes and demi-gods standing around
us, who will not let us sleep. Then they address
the imagination: only poetry inspires
poetry. They become the organic culture of
the time. College education is the reading of
certain books which the common sense of all
scholars agrees will represent the science already
accumulated. In the highest civilization,
the book is still the highest delight.</i></p>

<h1>READING: HOW TO TEACH IT.</h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="smaller">WHY DO WE READ?</span></h2>

<p>The power to read is so ordinary a
part of our mental equipment that
we rarely question its meaning or its origin.
All common things pass us unchallenged,
however marvellous they may
be. We take little note of our sunrises
and sunsets, the hill range which we see
every day from our window, the clear
air which infuses new energies into our
lives with every new morning. Common
institutions, however precious—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
home, the school, the church, the state—are
received by us as a matter of course,
just as children receive without surprise
the most valuable gifts from the hands
of their friends. We need not marvel,
then, that this power, which has so long
been a part of ourselves, should remain
unquestioned, or that we learn to read
without giving a thought to the motive
which impels us to learn. It may be
well for even the most thoughtful among
us to pause for a moment to question
why everybody learns to read; to ponder
the returns from the effort, the time,
and the pains spent in the mastery of
the art.</p>

<p>It is evident that our estimate of the
value of reading will depend upon our
kind of reading; or, in other words, the
kind of knowledge which we gain from
reading. For example, you and I may
turn to the daily newspaper for a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
knowledge to direct our everyday plans.
We wish to go to the city on the morrow:—this
evening’s paper warns us of
an approaching rain; we therefore provide
ourselves with an umbrella before
starting on our journey. Or we desire
to hear Nansen’s lecture:—the newspaper
apprises us of the time, the place,
the subject, the cost of tickets, the place
where they are to be sold, the arrangement
for extra trains. Or, again, we
plan a trip to Florida:—the ways and
means of going, the departure and arrival
of trains, the choice of routes, the
cost of the journey, the hotels which we
may expect to find, together with a
thousand other items,—all these are
learned by means of time-tables, guide-books,
and printed pamphlets, which we
carefully read before going. Without
this information which has been written
down for us, and without this power on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
our part to read it, our journey would
be to us like that of a traveller in
an unexplored country, except as our
friends give us the result of their experience.
The business man consults
the paper to learn of the quotations of
stocks and bonds, the arrival or departure
of ships, the scarcity or abundance
of crops. The enthusiastic bicyclist
learns of the proposed runs of the club
through the obliging columns of the
paper; his guide-book supplies the directions
which take him safely to his
journey’s end, or the descriptions which
interpret to him the places through
which he rides. Can we imagine ourselves
as bereft of this power of reading
the printed directions which are every
day consulted by us for our ordinary
convenience? How limited, how hindered
our lives would seem to us with
this power withdrawn!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Through the various agencies to which
we have referred, and similar sources
equally familiar to us, we share the experience
of others and add to our limited
life that which they have learned for us.
Our power is multiplied, our convenience
is assured, our happiness is increased by
means of the work which has been done
by others. The fruit of others’ thought
and experience is stored ready for our
use as soon as we have mastered the art
of reading. Therefore, in order that we
may add to our own power by sharing
the experience and wisdom of others in
the management of our everyday, practical
affairs, we have learned to read.</p>

<p>And, furthermore, as members of a
community we need to know what others
are doing. We cannot live to ourselves
alone. Ordinary intelligence demands a
knowledge of contemporary events. A
strike in the Fall River mills, a freshet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
in the Connecticut Valley, a cyclone in
Iowa, a frost in Florida, a famine or a
pestilence in India, a war in Cuba, the
threatened partition of China, the accession
of Hawaii, are matters which pertain
to us also. In these days of rapid
transmission of intelligence, the world
has become one great family, and in
proportion as one recognizes his responsibility
to the brotherhood of which he
is a member, he will be interested to
know the deeds of other men, the happenings
in other communities. These
exert a direct influence upon our own
environment. Therefore we read to obtain
knowledge of the life about us, in
countries near and remote; and in proportion
as our interest is wide and intelligent
does such reading become a necessity
to us.</p>

<p>Moreover, an intelligent judgment of
the events of the present involves a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
knowledge of the past, which to so large
a degree determines the present. What
men have done, what they have discovered,
what they have thought, in the
ages that are past, enables us to interpret
the present. A complete knowledge
of our own time is the possession
only of the man who can read the past.
The history of any nation, the development
of any art or science, the growth
of any religion can be known only to
him who reads. The student of his
own times must turn to the life of the
yesterdays for answers to the problems
which are confronting him. The experience
of the past has been chronicled
in books in order that we may share the
blessings of that experience. How narrow
seems the life of the person who is
without the power to read even the outlines
of that history! We have but to
imagine the books of the past as closed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
to the entire world, and the power of
reading as cut off from every one, to
realize the individual loss when the
power of thus reading is withheld. It
is a recognized truth that the broader
one’s life, the greater his consciousness
of the necessity for general knowledge
such as is gained from books.</p>

<p>A fourth type of reading is suggested
by the ministrations of literature. If
we imagine ourselves as seated by the
study table reading our favorite poem,
we shall recognize that it has been
through the reading of literature that
much of our highest inspiration has
come to us. It is the poet who brings
to us true insight into our own experience,
who interprets for us the great
problems of life. With what joy and
exultation we recall our magnificent
hymns! What waves of emotion sweep
over us as we read the lines in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the master hand has recorded the deepest
experiences! For enjoyment, for
culture, for spiritual help we turn to
the higher order of books. In the truest
sense, this reading directs our lives,
interprets our experiences, and determines
our ideals. We cannot imagine
ourselves as defrauded of this birthright.
How meagre would our lives
at once become if every vestige of the
treasures of literature was removed from
our experience:—the army without the
battle hymn, the home without the
poem, the struggle without the psalm
of courage, the mortal defeat without
the inspiring shout of spiritual triumph!
In attempting thus to picture a life
without the inspiration of literature, we
realize our dependence upon its teachings.
The higher our conception of living,
the fuller our realization of the help
which comes to us through literature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Our motives in reading, then, may be
recorded in an ascending series: To
obtain practical guidance in everyday
affairs; to enrich our lives with the experience
of our neighbors; to share the
wisdom resulting from the experience of
the past; to gain pleasure, insight, and
spiritual direction. Any one of these
motives would be sufficient to warrant
us in teaching reading; through any one
of these results we are fitted to become
better members of the community. But
can we draw the line, giving to our children
the lower results only, where so
much might well be given?</p>

<p>We have asked why we read, and
the question which naturally follows is:
“What shall we read?” We must be
able to read ordinary facts affecting our
everyday life, expressed in the terms of
that life. Such reading involves little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
growth. Its purposes are exceedingly
practical in the ordinary sense of the
term. There is little widening of our
horizon, little deepening of our experience
in consequence of such practice.
Second, we should read such books and
papers as will serve to inform us of
contemporary events,—such events as
really have a bearing upon our present
environment or the life of the future.
This reading gives us knowledge of
other peoples and places, widening our
horizon, and urging us back to study,
with clearer eyes, the environment which
has been constantly about us. Only
thus can we truly see the life which is
nearest to us. Third, the reading of
the past leads us to the pages of history
in which the best has been chronicled.
As has been said, the knowledge of the
present can be obtained only through
the interpretation of the past. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
life is narrow indeed which confines its
range to the present alone. And fourth,
we must be able to read and interpret
literature, a reading which requires a
fuller power than any which has been
heretofore described, and involves a
higher type of teaching.</p>

<p>In the thought of many parents and
friends of the school, the immediately
practical aim of reading is the only one
considered. Because reading facilitates
buying and selling, coming and going,
and is ordinarily accepted as a mark of
intelligence, it is considered as an essential
in our school courses. But the
higher our conception of life, the higher
will be our conception of education; and
with the higher conception of education
comes the acceptance of the higher aim,
even in our simplest teaching. We may
learn to read in such a way that we
never rise beyond the first result of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
attainment. This will almost assuredly
be the case if the so-called “practical”
aim is the only one considered; but if,
from the beginning, the teacher’s hope
and that of the parent are that the child
may grow into fuller power, we shall
find his life strengthened and inspired
by the loftier aim, by the surer accomplishment
of the greater result. “Seek
ye first the kingdom of God and his
righteousness, and all these things shall
be added unto you.” The old saying is
far from being interpreted in these days
of hurrying to obtain the immediate and
the practical,—but it is forever true that
as our aim becomes higher, the type of
our work becomes nobler, while the
character of the results justifies our endeavors.
The greater will include the
less, but the lower aim may never lead
to the higher. Can we dare to withhold
from our children the comfort, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
inspiration, the strength, the guidance
that has come to us through the higher
type of reading? Is it not a necessity
that, from the beginning, they shall be
taught to look forward to such power of
acquisition as shall open to them the
treasures of experience which have been
written down for them in the best
books?</p>

<span class="smaller">LITERATURE IN THE SCHOOL-ROOM.</span></h2>

<p>Learning to read is an important
part of the children’s training, but
learning <em>what</em> to read is quite as important.
A child’s mastery of the printed
page may leave him with the key to that
which is base and ignoble in literature,
or it may open to him that which is
noble and inspiring. His newly gotten
power may unlock to him the dime
novel, or the Iliad. Whether he turns
to the one or to the other depends
largely upon his early associations. It
is determined especially by his early
teaching.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>To present the right standard or pattern
is one of the functions of the
teacher. This is equally true whether
the lesson be the form of a Latin verb,
the shape of a vase, the polite fashion of
address, or the choice of books. To set
the copy was of old the teacher’s part,
and it must still occupy a prominent
place in our work. For the sake of giving
the children right ideals, we must
place before them the best in literature,
such literature as will supply not only
standards in language, but ideals in
character. Their experience, like ours,
must be reënforced by the teachings of
others—the lessons which have been
treasured in books—and these lessons
must begin in childhood. It is a mistake
to postpone good literature until
the child has mastered word forms and
the technique of reading. His love for
the good must exist before he begins to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
read at all, and must be stimulated and
strengthened by means of his reading.
At the same time that he becomes master
of the mechanics of reading, he
should be endowed with the desire to
choose that which is good to read. The
work of the teacher, therefore, is to
establish ideals, to quicken desire, to
strengthen right tendencies, to lead to
wise choices. These belong to the teaching
of reading, and should assume quite
as important a place as does the mastery
of words, or fluency in expression.</p>

<p>As has been said, good literature
should not be postponed until the children
can read it for themselves. A
study of our own experience will assure
us that the teachings of our childhood
have made the most lasting impression
upon us. It is the childhood association
which moves us most strongly to-day.
As the twig is bent the tree is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
inclined. There comes a time in the
tree’s history when its inclination is
fixed. It is the young tree which is
shaped by the skill of the nurseryman.
The best of poems should be read and
recited to little children. “Tell me a
story,” or “Read to me,” is the oft-repeated
plea in the home. It indicates
the child’s desire, and his need as well.
Let us be taught by the children. Here
is our opportunity to present to them
the story that is worth telling, the poem
that is worth reading. “Tell it again,”
we hear, after every recital, and again
and again and again the loved story is
repeated. Should we not be assured
that the oft-heard word is worthy of this
frequent repetition? If the child asks
for bread, shall we give him a stone?</p>

<p>In the home, long before the child enters
school, he should become familiar
with true stories, fairy stories, exquisite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
songs, beautiful poems, adapted to his
intelligence, suited to his interest. If
this good work has been done at home
it should be continued by the teacher.
If it has been neglected by the home
friends, it necessarily becomes a part of
the teacher’s work. The child’s mind
should be furnished with the best stories
and poems before he begins his primer.
So shall he long to master the art which
shall open books to him for his own
reading, and every step which his baby
feet take in the path to his desire shall
bring him consciously nearer to the
longed-for treasure.</p>

<p>Through the first years of the school
life, telling stories, reciting poems, or
reading to the children should be a frequent
exercise. This may occur in the
time of the reading lesson, in the language
lesson, or the morning talk. The
benefits derived from this practice are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
two-fold. The stories and the poems
give to the children new material for
thought; they also help them to acquire
a taste for good things which will cause
them to choose instinctively that which
is good when they are left free to choose.
Children who have been accustomed to
the stories of the Iliad, will read and
re-read this treasure in later life with an
advantage which could not have been
theirs had not the heroes of the old
story been the companions of their
childhood’s thought. We can hardly
imagine that boys accustomed to such
associations will be satisfied with the
cheap and pernicious pages of the dime
novel. A mind well furnished with
good things will appropriate good to
itself. It is the empty head which becomes
filled with that which is cheap
and mean. The children of a certain
city were once asked without previous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
notice to write down something which
they had memorized. Those who had
not been taught in school to memorize
choice selections, wrote pages of curious
and uncouth rhymes, which they had
learned in various ways. The exercise
proved conclusively that they must be
helped to choose wisely. The choice
will never be between the good and
nothing, fulness and emptiness: it will
always be a choice between the good
and the bad.</p>

<p>Let us read to the children, then.
Let their own desires guide our selection
in the beginning. The true story,
the fairy story, the poem, may be read
or recited in turn. The children’s plea
for repetition will teach us what their
present choice is. If we are wise we
shall be instructed by their comments
and questions.</p>

<p>Three rules should guide our choice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of literature: First, give the children
what is good. Second, give them what
we like. Third, give them what they
like.</p>

<p>The first rule needs no interpretation.
With so much that is precious waiting
to be taught, we cannot be satisfied
with any lesson material worthless in
itself. Life is too short and its time
too sacred to admit of such harmful
dallying.</p>

<p>The second rule is always a safe one.
We must teach that which belongs to
us. We cannot give to the children
what is not ours to give. The poem
or story which we enjoy because it answers
to something in our nature, we
shall be able to teach to them. We
may repeat, but we cannot teach, that
which has not entered into our own
lives. Therefore, if we do not love and
appreciate what is good in literature, our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
first duty is to teach ourselves, in order
that we may be prepared to teach the
children.</p>

<p>The third rule necessitates a study of
the children as well as a study of literature.
Songs and stories which are entirely
suited to one class may fail to
interest another. Those which we like
may not attract the children. Hence,
we must watch them through our story-telling
or our reading, and judge, by
their attention, their comments, their
silence, their indifference, where their
interest lies. We must begin with that
which appeals to their child life, their
present interest; but we shall not end
there. We must lead them to a fuller
enjoyment and to a wider interest, by
giving them always a little more than
that for which they ask.</p>

<p>There is much in the pages of the best
literature which is already suited to children’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
understanding. Let us choose
that first. But we shall dare to add
much which they do not fully understand
as yet, knowing that the future
will interpret to them that which is now
hidden. It is a mistake to cut literature
to the children’s comprehension.
Let us trust that they will feel in some
measure the beauty which they cannot
understand, and that their future experience
will unlock the door which is
now shut to them.</p>

<p>The writer remembers a class of children—children
who came from rude
homes, whose lives were narrow and
hindered, who, nevertheless, listened
with intense interest to the poems
which their teacher read to them. It
happened that she once selected for
the morning reading the first stanzas of
Longfellow’s poem, “My Lost Youth.”
They listened eagerly until the book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
was closed, giving evidence of appreciation
with every return of the rhythmic
refrain. “Is that all?” they asked.
“No,” was the reply, “but you would
not understand the rest.” “Oh, read it
to us, even if we don’t,” they urged.
“We love the sound of it.”</p>

<p>The writer has often heard primary
classes reciting Wordsworth’s “Daffodils”
with great delight. Without
doubt the child’s interpretation differs
from that of the man,—understanding
is the fruit of experience,—but even thus
early the children enter into the spirit
of the poem, rejoice in the beauty of
the daffodils, and are happy in the rhythmic
recitation. The beautiful words are
treasured in their memories, to return
again and again to gladden their hearts,
just as the bright vision was repeated in
the experience of the poet.</p>

<p>Give to the children, then, not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the child thought which fits the childish
experience, but also the treasure which
grows in beauty as they grow, and becomes
rich as they become wise.</p>

<p>It is well for the teacher to cultivate
the art of telling stories to children.
The story that is told has an element of
life which is not found in the story that
is read. There is no barrier between
the story-teller and his audience; the
book often makes a gulf between the
reader and his hearers. Practise story-telling.
Let the children’s indifference
teach you wherein you fail; your unconscious
tutors will show you what
to omit and what to magnify. Their
training will help you in other directions.
If you yield yourself to the
teaching of the children, you will be repaid
by a new readiness in story-telling
before less kindly and less candid critics.
Do not forego this privilege.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>It is well to read and re-read the poem
or story until it becomes the child’s own
possession. The term “Memory Gem”
has been adopted into our familiar school
phrases. Whether the phrase remains
or not, it is to be hoped that the exercise
which it names will always have a
place. It has an advantage beyond simply
reading or hearing the poem. The
poem which has been committed to
memory and recited again and again,
becomes the child’s own. It will recur
to him at his play, at his work, in school
and out. No other thought treasure is
so dear to us as that which is learned in
childhood, and which accompanies us
through life. Through such indirect
teaching, we may remain an influence
for good even when our names have
been forgotten. By means of such tuition
the child becomes familiar with the
vocabulary of good literature, and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
prepared to read, understand, and enjoy
that which would otherwise have been
beyond his reach. By all means continue
the “memory gem,” but be assured
that the selections are truly
gems.</p>

<p>A poem or story may be presented to
a child as a message from the author to
him. Whittier’s “Barefoot Boy,” for
example, serves not only to describe the
barefoot boy, but to tell the children
something about the poet himself. If
they read it with this thought in mind,
they will be desirous of learning something
about the poet. This study of
the author should not precede the study
of the poem. They will care to learn
about Whittier because he has written
this charming poem for them; now, facts
about his life will be filled with meaning;
they will rejoice in the story of his boyhood
experience, and will return to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
“The Barefoot Boy” with a keener
interest, because it has become real to
them through their study of the poet’s
life. For little children (and is it not
true of grown-up children as well?) this
is the natural order of teaching. We
care to know about Scott because we
delight in “Marmion” and “Ivanhoe”;
we do not first learn about the author,
and then decide to read his works.</p>

<p>Other things being equal, our selections
for reading and for memorizing should
be from the world’s best writers. We
should at least be sure that the children’s
course of reading gives them
some sense of companionship with a
few men and women who have blessed
the world through their books. Hans
Christian Andersen, Alice and Phœbe
Cary, Mary Howitt, Longfellow, Whittier,
Lowell, Robert Louis Stevenson,
and Eugene Field have written some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
their best thoughts for children as well
as for men and women. Some of these
names should stand for real personalities,
nay, for friends, to the children,
before they leave school.</p>

<p>One question is often asked by teachers:
“Shall I give myths to the children,
and how? and can I give them if
I do not believe them nor like them at
all myself?” Somewhere, sometime,
somehow, the children should become
familiar with the classic myths. The
“sometime” should be in childhood,
or the myths will never fulfil their
true mission. They should come at
the time when children delight in the
marvellous, the fanciful, the grotesque.
Rightly used, they help to develop the
imagination, a power which is left sadly
to itself in school life. They serve as a
basis for future reading. A knowledge
of them is necessary to the interpretation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of the best in literature. By all
means give them to the children, but
give them in their best form. They
should not be mutilated by any attempt
to embody them in words of one syllable.
Let the child’s reading of the
myths wait until he is able to read some
version couched in the purest English.
Meanwhile, read them to him again and
again, sometimes without note or comment,
for explanations are often bungling
attempts to explain that which can
never be explained. Let the child absorb
into himself what the story conveys
to him. Answer his questions plainly,
if you can. Tell him you do not know,
if you do not; but do not spoil his visions
by attempting to teach vaporized
theories.</p>

<p>Enough has been said of the teacher’s
duty in the direction of developing
taste. It is self-evident that no teacher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
can help a child to appreciate that
which is beautiful, unless she herself
appreciates it. The fountain cannot
rise higher than its source. We must
be that which we would help the children
to become. Therefore, it is of the
utmost importance that the teacher’s
reading be carefully directed. I know of
no way in which a teacher can better
serve her children than by reading the
best books. This reading will be, of
course, in the line of her own tastes
and interests. Every year, at the least,
a new book should become a teacher’s
possession. She should not only buy it
to keep, but she should read and re-read
it, until its contents become a part of
herself. Every year should widen her
horizon, and enable her to see more
truly than she has seen before. Every
book thus read and re-read becomes a
definite force in her life, and unconsciously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
directs her teaching. The
teacher who would guide her pupils in
the fields of literature, must herself frequent
the paths in which she desires
their feet to tread.</p>

<span class="smaller">LEARNING TO READ.</span></h2>

<p>The problem of teaching would be
solved could the teacher know how
her well-devised plan of action really
affects her pupil. Patiently and persistently
she follows her foreordained
method, but who can know the critical
moment when the mind opens to take in
the new idea, and to delight in the consciousness
of growth? Who can name
or describe the Open Sesame that unlocks
the world of books to the child?</p>

<p>A clear light is thrown upon our common
problem by the charming description
of one child’s experience. Hugh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Miller, in his “Schools and Schoolmasters,”
tells us how he learned to
read, or, rather, learned to love reading.
We quote at length:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I had been sent, previous to my father’s
death, to a dame’s school, where I was taught
to pronounce my letters to such effect in
the old Scottish mode, that still, when I attempt
spelling a word aloud, which is not
often,—for I find the process a perilous one,—the
<i>aa’s</i>, and <i>ee’s</i>, and <i>uh’s</i>, and <i>rau’s</i>, return
upon me, and I have to translate them, with
no little hesitation, as I go along, into the
more modish sounds. A knowledge of the
letters themselves I had already acquired by
studying the signposts of the place,—rare
works of art, that excited my utmost admiration,
with jugs, and glasses, and bottles, and
ships, and loaves of bread upon them; all of
which could, as the artist intended, be actually
recognized. During my sixth year, I
spelt my way, under the dame, through the
Shorter Catechism, the Proverbs, and the New
Testament, and then entered upon her highest
form, as a member of the Bible Class; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
all the while, the process of acquiring learning
had been a dark one, which I slowly mastered,
in humble confidence in the awful
wisdom of the schoolmistress, not knowing
whither it tended,—when at once my mind
awoke to the meaning of that most delightful
of all narratives, the story of Joseph. Was
there ever such a discovery made before! I
actually found out for myself, that the art of
reading is the art of finding stories in books,
and from that moment reading became one
of the most delightful of my amusements. I
began by getting into a corner at the dismissal
of the school, and there conning over to
myself the new-found story of Joseph; nor
did one perusal serve; the other Scripture
stories followed,—in especial, the story of
Samson and the Philistines, of David and
Goliath, of the prophets Elijah and Elisha;
and after that came the New Testament stories
and parables. Assisted by my uncles, I began
to collect a library in a box of birch-bark
about nine inches square, which I found quite
large enough to contain a great many immortal
works,—“Jack the Giant-Killer,” and
“Jack and the Bean-Stalk,” and the “Yellow
Dwarf,” and “Blue Beard,” and “Sindbad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the Sailor,” and “Beauty and the Beast,”
and “Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp,”
with several others of resembling character.</p>

<p>Those intolerable nuisances, the useful-knowledge
books, had not yet arisen, like
tenebrious stars, on the educational horizon,
to darken the world, and shed their blighting
influence on the opening intellect of the
“youthhood”; and so, from my rudimental
books—books that made themselves truly
such by their thorough assimilation with the
rudimental mind—I passed on, without being
conscious of break or line of division, to
books on which the learned are content to
write commentaries and dissertations, but
which I found to be quite as nice children’s
books as any of the others. Old Homer
wrote admirably for little folk, especially in
the “Odyssey”; a copy of which, in the
only true translation extant,—for, judging
from its surpassing interest and the wrath of
critics, such I hold that of Pope to be,—I
found in the house of a neighbor. Next
came the “Iliad”; not, however, in a complete
copy, but represented by four of the six
volumes of Bernard Lintot. With what
power, and at how early an age, true genius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
impresses! I saw, even at this immature
period, that no writer could cast a javelin
with half the force of Homer. The missiles
went whizzing athwart his pages; and I could
see the momentary gleam of the steel, ere it
buried itself deep in brass and bull-hide. I
next succeeded in discovering for myself a
child’s book, of not less interest than even
the “Iliad,” which might, I was told, be
read on Sabbaths, in a magnificent old edition
of “Pilgrim’s Progress,” printed on
coarse, whity-brown paper, and charged with
numerous woodcuts, each of which occupied
an entire page, that, on principles of economy,
bore letterpress on the other side. And
such delightful prints as these were! It must
have been some such volume that sat for its
portrait to Wordsworth, and which he so exquisitely
describes as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Profuse in garniture of wooden cuts,</div>
<div class="verse">Strange and uncouth; dire faces, figures dire,</div>
<div class="verse">Sharp-kneed, sharp-elbowed, and lean-ankled, too,</div>
<div class="verse">With long and ghastly shanks,—forms which, once seen,</div>
<div class="verse">Could never be forgotten.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>In process of time I had devoured, besides
these genial works, “Robinson Crusoe,”
“Gulliver’s Travels,” “Ambrose on Angels,”
the judgment chapter in Howie’s “Scotch
Worthies,” Byron’s “Narrative,” and the
“Adventures of Philip Quarll,” with a good
many other adventures and voyages, real and
fictitious, part of a very miscellaneous collection
of books made by my father. It was a
melancholy little library to which I had fallen
heir. Most of the missing volumes had been
with the master aboard the vessel when he
perished. Of an early edition of Cook’s
“Voyages,” all the volumes were now absent
save the first; and a very tantalizing romance
in four volumes, Mrs. Ratcliff’s “Mysteries
of Udolpho,” was represented by only the
earlier two. Small as the collection was, it
contained some rare books,—among the rest,
a curious little volume entitled, “The Miracles
of Nature and Art,” to which we find Dr.
Johnson referring, in one of the dialogues
chronicled by Boswell, as scarce even in his
day, and which had been published, he said,
some time in the seventeenth century by a
bookseller whose shop hung perched on Old
London Bridge, between sky and water. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
contained, too, the only copy I ever saw of
the “Memoirs of a Protestant condemned to
the Galleys of France for his Religion,”—a
work interesting from the circumstance that,
though it bore another name on its title-page,
it had been translated from the French for a
few guineas by poor Goldsmith in his days of
obscure literary drudgery, and exhibited the
peculiar excellences of his style. The collection
boasted, beside, of a very curious old
book, illustrated by very uncouth plates, that
detailed the perils and sufferings of an English
sailor who had spent his best years of life
as a slave in Morocco. It had its volumes of
sound theology, too, and of stiff controversy,—Flavel’s
“Works,” and Henry’s “Commentary,”
and Hutchinson on the “Lesser
Prophets,” and a very old treatise on the
“Revelation,” with the title-page away, and
blind Jameson’s volume on the “Hierarchy,”
with first editions of “Naphthali,” “The
Cloud of Witnesses,” and “The Hind let
Loose.” But with these solid authors I did
not venture to grapple until long after this
time. Of the works of fact and incident
which it contained, those of the voyagers
were my especial favorites. I perused with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
avidity the voyages of Anson, Drake, Raleigh,
Dampier, and Captain Woods Rogers, and
my mind became so filled with conceptions
of what was to be seen and done in foreign
parts, that I wished myself big enough to be
a sailor, that I might go and see coral islands
and burning mountains, and hunt wild beasts
and fight battles.</p>

<p>These reminiscences are most suggestive.
Do they not find a parallel in our
memory of our childhood conquest of
the art of reading?</p>

<p>Before planning her lessons in reading,
the teacher will do well to review her
own experience in reading, or to scan
the difficulties which she has encountered
in teaching other classes. A brief
analysis of her experiences, both as a
pupil and as a teacher, will reveal distinct
lines of achievement in learning to
read. These are illustrated in any act
of reading.</p>

<div class="verse">“The old familiar sights of ours</div>
<div class="verse">Took marvellous shapes. Strange domes and towers</div>
<div class="verse">Rose up where sty and corncrib stood,</div>
<div class="verse">Or garden wall, or belt of wood.</div>

<p class="noindent"><b>To read</b>,—that is, to get the meaning of
these lines; or, if one reads aloud, to get
and to give the meaning. One who
truly reads “Snow-Bound” learns to
see the scenes which Whittier so beautifully
describes; to see them as he saw
them, with tender affection, and to interpret
the deeper meaning of the lines
of “homely toil and destiny obscure.”</p>

<p>Manifestly this involves much. On the
surface, and first attracting the attention
of the teacher, appears the obvious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
necessity of knowing the words at sight.
Familiarity with the forms of the words
used is indispensable to reading. This
involves knowing the sounds of the
words, while the power to pronounce
new words readily calls for knowledge
of the laws of English pronunciation.</p>

<p>In the minds of too many teachers of
little children, such mastery of word pronunciation
is held as reading. But this
is a grievous error, which leads to narrow
and mechanical work, and obscures
the high purpose of real reading. Reference
to the definition of reading, and
a study of the selection from “Snow-Bound,”
will show us the proper value
of this achievement and its relation to
true reading. The words are the vehicle
of thought, a means to an end. Their
mastery is indispensable to reading, but
the reader must compass, not the single
word-speaking, but the meaning of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
related words which express the author’s
thought. Knowledge of the meaning of
the words used, and especially the meaning
of the words as Whittier uses them,
is necessary to a clear understanding of
the poem. The reader who would understand
the poem must know something
of farm life—the sty and the corncrib,
the garden wall, the wellcurb, the
sweep, and the other accessories of the
farm which Whittier names or describes.
Plainly, too, his knowledge must extend
further—to a Chinese roof, and Pisa’s
leaning miracle. To such knowledge,
observation of common life must minister,
coupled with the study of books and
pictures. In other words, the reader
interprets Whittier’s “Snow-Bound” by
virtue of his own experience, reënforced
by the experience of others as written
down in books, or pictured with brush
or pen. To the formal word-mastery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
then, must be added study of the meaning
of new words, or recalling such experience
as explains the old. The content,
as well as the form, of the word
must be studied.</p>

<p>Added to such study, is the general
training which gives us power to picture
the unknown, interpreting a new scene
through its relation to our old experience.
The ready and trained imagination
easily pictures the scene which the
words conjure before the mind—makes
real the homestead, snowbound and comfortfilled.
Reading may be so taught
as to develop this power, which takes
hold on things unseen. No careful
teacher omits such training.</p>

<p>Here, then, are different phases of
teaching reading: mastery of the words
as to form and sound; explanation of
the meaning of new words, through
observation or reading; lessons which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
tend to develop power of imagination.</p>

<p>The young child who leaves his home
and his play to enter upon the life of the
school-room finds a new world awaiting
him, with manifold new experiences.
Hitherto he has romped and rambled to
his heart’s content. All his friends and
playmates have in turn been his teachers,
albeit theirs has been an unconscious
tuition. His lessons have been in the
line of his desires, or suggested by his
natural environment. Longfellow pictures
the little Hiawatha in the arms of
his first teacher, the loving old Nokomis:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“At the door on summer evenings</div>
<div class="verse">Sat the little Hiawatha,</div>
<div class="verse">Heard the whispering of the pine-trees,</div>
<div class="verse">Heard the lapping of the water—</div>
<div class="verse">Sounds of music, words of wonder;—</div>
<div class="verse">Saw the moon rise from the water,</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
<div class="verse">Rippling, rounding from the water,</div>
<div class="verse">Saw the flecks and shadows on it,</div>
<div class="verse">Whispered, ‘What is that, Nokomis?’</div>
<div class="verse">And the good Nokomis answered—”</div>
<div class="verse">…</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The moon, the rainbow in the heaven,
the Milky Way, the firefly, the owl and
owlet, the beaver, the rabbit, the squirrel—these
saluted the baby boy, and awakened
his interest. “What is that?” he
cried, with eager question. “And the
good Nokomis answered.” The little
Hiawatha “learned of every bird its language.”
He was taught, not by old
Nokomis alone, but by bird and beast,
flower and field.</p>

<p>So with every child who enters the
school-room upon that fateful first Monday
in September. He brings with him,
not an empty head, but a mind stored
with the memories of varied experiences.
Just as the little Hiawatha gazed, pondered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
questioned, learned—so this child
has seen, has heard, has questioned, has
thought, has acted. What he brings to
school, who can tell? What has he seen
and heard? What has he liked and desired?
What has he questioned and
learned? How little we know of this
unwritten history! And yet it determines
the net result of all our teaching.
For nothing which we attempt to teach
finds lodgment in the child mind unless
it is linked with some past experience
and awakens actual interest. Much of
our reiterated instruction falls upon deaf
ears, fails utterly to awaken the dormant
interest, because it is ill chosen. We
must know something about the life of
the children before we can wisely teach
them.</p>

<p>The thoughtful teacher remembers
this truth and directs her work accordingly.
Instead of rushing with headlong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
zeal into the routine of reading, writing,
and number—under the impulsion of the
Course of Study, and the memory of
classes which failed to “pass”—she
makes haste slowly, and devotes the first
days of the term to lessons which help
to reveal the experience of the children.
Observation of and talks about common
things; conversations which lead the
children to tell what they can do, or like
to do; story telling; picture drawing;—these
afford opportunity for expression,
and serve to show the teacher something
of her pupils’ attainments, and the line
of their interests as well. Meanwhile,
they are becoming accustomed to the
school-room routine, and so emerge from
the period in which they gazed, dumb
and dazed, at the many marvels with
which this new school world is crowded.
They come to know the teacher as their
friend, and they become free and confident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
in her presence. Thus the true
atmosphere of the school-room is created—the
only atmosphere in which wholesome
and natural teaching and learning
can thrive.</p>

<p>This is not a prodigal misuse of time.
It is the part of thrift to so spend in the
beginning, for the returns are evident in
the ease and readiness with which pupils
and teacher afterward work together—the
value of every lesson being enhanced
by the mutual good will and understanding.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/line.jpg" width="500" height="40" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The school differs from the home and
the kindergarten in that its allotted tasks
are evidently determined by a motive
and plan outside the child’s comprehension.
In many cases this must be so.
The lessons which involve the mastery
of the symbols used in reading, writing,
and number, or the drill and practice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
necessary to attain skill in music or
drawing or writing, have no self-evident
goal for the child. So many lines, so
many letters, so many problems, he attempts,
because the teacher says so, and
in his new universe the teacher is supreme.
At home he has always chosen
more or less; so, too, in the kindergarten
his interest and choice determined
the story or the game or the topic of conversation.
He has delighted in building
houses, modelling balls, weaving mats,
playing games—and all, so far as he
knew, for his own immediate pleasure
and accomplishment. Other results, to
him unknown, were of course secured.
He builded better than he knew. But
in every case he rejoiced in some immediate
accomplishment which he desired.</p>

<p>In too many cases the decreed exercises
of the school are meaningless and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
purposeless to the beginner. Such exercises
easily degenerate into dull and
fruitless routine, indifferent and profitless
to teacher and pupil alike. To
arouse desire and awaken conscious
motive is the teacher’s most important
work, and in teaching reading it
should receive first consideration. She,
therefore, after securing such freedom
and coöperation as promise a fertile
soil for her seed-planting, calls the
children about her to explain the purpose
of the lessons which will fill their
days.</p>

<p>Perhaps she reads to them a story
which they like, a new story which they
have never heard. When she reaches
the interesting climax she pauses to say,
“I haven’t time to read the rest of the
story now. How I wish you could read!
Then you might take the book and read
the story yourselves. Would you not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
like to learn to read, so that you could
read stories like these?”</p>

<p>In Hugh Miller’s graphic description
of his childhood experience in reading,
this element of purpose and desire is
strongly emphasized. “The process of
learning and acquiring had been a dark
one,” he says, recalling his struggles
with letters and syllables. He “slowly
mastered” these “in humble confidence
in the awful wisdom of the schoolmistress,
not knowing whither it tended,”
when (as a member of the Bible Class—“in
the highest form”) his mind
“awoke to the meaning of that most
delightful of all narratives, the story of
Joseph. Was there ever such a discovery
made before?”</p>

<p>Such testimony might be repeated a
thousand times over, by our pupils of
to-day—if they were able to describe
their common experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the first vision of the goal that
gave meaning, motive, and conscious
gladness to Hugh Miller’s study. Such
motive and such meaning should pervade
the earliest lessons in reading, and
should be consciously recognized by pupil
as well as teacher. We repeat, then:
the teacher’s first effort, after becoming
acquainted with her children, is to
awaken this conscious desire to read,
and to secure intelligent coöperation in
her exercises.</p>

<p>One teacher suggests writing upon the
board some sentence which has been
whispered to her by the children, and
then calling an older child from another
room to read the secret. This is done
again and again, until the children are
eager to share the power which their
comrade possesses, and turn gladly to
the tasks required of them, that they
may the sooner reach their goal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a wide difference between
such teaching and the routine drill which
does not enlist the child’s desire. The
enthusiastic bicyclist would smile if asked
to exchange his morning ride to the city
for an hour’s exercise upon a fixed “bicycle
exerciser” in the back hall. Nor
could the most skilful pedagogue convince
him that the exercise involved in
making the wheel go round is as valuable
as the spin which carries him to his
destination, through the fresh morning
air, along roads bordered with flowered
fields. Yet the contrast is no more
marked than that between the task of the
syllable-pronouncer, who obediently performs
his meaningless labor, and that of
the child who, with conscious and earnest
desire, sets himself to learn to read.</p>

<p>In order to give some sense of
immediate achievement, the sentences
of the first lessons should express<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
thoughts in which the children are interested.</p>

<ul>
<li>This is Kate.</li>
<li>Kate can read.</li>
<li>Kate has a book.</li>
<li>Read to me, Kate.</li>
<li>Kate can read.</li>
<li>I can read, too.</li>
<li>Kate has a book.</li>
<li>I have a book, too.</li>
<li>See Kate’s book!</li>
<li>See my book!</li>
<li>Kate has a doll.</li>
<li>I have a doll, too.</li>
<li>Kate has a kitty.</li>
<li>I have a dog.</li>
<li>Kate likes her doll.</li>
<li>I like my dog.</li>
<li>See my dog!</li>
<li>See Kate’s little kitty!</li>
<li>Come, little Kitty.</li>
<li>Come to me, Kitty.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>The object of these preparatory lessons
is to give some consciousness of the
purpose of reading, and some sense of
achievement. The sentences are the
children’s, obtained in a conversation
concerning Kate, who is an older pupil,
or some pictured child. The sentence
is the unit, and is read by the teacher.
The children repeat the sentence after
her reading.</p>

<p>Of course these first efforts are not
reading. They simply represent the
children’s memory of the teacher’s words
and tone. Often, when asked to read
alone, the child dashes at the wrong sentence
with his pointer, which vainly wanders
in search of the right one. But just
as the frequent observation of the loved
story in the picture book not only fixes
the words in their order, but enables the
young listener to find some of them upon
the page, so, by repetition of these first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
sentences, the words are at last held in
the mind, and are recognized in new
places and under new relations. The
attentive eye will recognize the new
words, first in their wonted place in the
sentence, then when isolated. At first
the words selected for repetition and
recognition are those which present fewest
difficulties;—not by any means the
shortest words—as <b>a</b>, <b>is</b>, <b>too</b>—but the
meaningful words, the nouns and adjectives,
and verbs which denote action.
<b>Kate</b>, <b>book</b>, <b>doll</b>, <b>dog</b>, <b>kitty</b>—these are
the first and easiest, in the lessons written
above. Later, <b>see</b> and <b>likes</b>, with
<b>can read</b>. Later still, <b>I have</b>, <b>this is</b>—while
<b>is</b> and <b>a</b> will not be emphasized as
units until the eyes have been trained to
distinguish more readily, and the words
have become familiar through constant
repetition.</p>

<p>Such lessons should continue for several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
weeks, introducing the various dear
and oft-seen objects of the child’s environment,
and the actions with which he
has long been familiar. The sentences
should be worth reading, and grouped
in coherent paragraphs. Drill in recognizing
the words should follow the
sentence reading, in every day’s lesson.</p>

<p>When the children can recognize at
sight a vocabulary of one hundred to
two hundred words, they should begin
to compare them, and to place in
groups those which are alike in sound.
For example: <b>book</b>, <b>look</b>, and <b>brook</b>
are known; <b>red</b> and <b>fed</b>; <b>cat</b>, <b>hat</b>,
and <b>pat</b>; <b>Fan</b>, <b>ran</b>, <b>can</b>, and <b>Dan</b>.
Placed in lists, their similarity is evident:</p>

<ul>
<li>book</li>
<li>look</li>
<li><i>took</i></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>fed</li>
<li>red</li>
<li><i>bed</i></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>cat</li>
<li>hat</li>
<li><i>sat</i></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Fan</li>
<li>ran</li>
<li><i>man</i></li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Some one volunteers to increase the list,
adding <b>took</b>, <b>bed</b>, <b>sat</b>, and <b>man</b>. Here
is the beginning of the analysis of words
into their sounds, and with this lesson
a new feature appears in our word
study.</p>

<p>Such lessons in sentence reading as
have been suggested, if continued long
enough and with sufficient discretion on
the part of the teacher, might enable a
class to read independently—for, even
without the teacher’s direction, obvious
likenesses and differences in words are
noted by the children, and rules are deduced
therefrom. But the mastery of a
large vocabulary is readily secured only
through attention to the common laws
of pronunciation, and familiarity with
the sound units. Thus far every word
has been presented as a new unit. Now
the children should learn that these
words are like many others in form, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
that the pronunciation of one serves as
a key to the many. Knowing <b>book</b>, all
monosyllables ending in <b>ook</b> can at once
enter their vocabulary of recognizable
words; knowing <b>Fan</b>, all monosyllables
with the <b>an</b> ending are known. The
missing factor is the knowledge of the
sounds of the separate letters which are
initials in these group words—<b>m-an</b>,
<b>F-an</b>, <b>c-an</b>, <b>r-an</b>, <b>t-an</b>, <b>p-an</b>. At this
juncture these sounds should be taught.</p>

<p>There has been some question among
teachers as to the time for teaching
sounds of the letters. It is wise to defer
this teaching until the children have
acquired some little facility in reading,
and understand its purpose, that their
work may not be approached from the
mechanical side solely. Again, the vocabulary
which the children already know
reveals groups of similar words and
suggests the wisdom of analysis and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
classification. And, further, the too
early attempt to study the lists of similar
words and to select and emphasize
them for use in reading, drives the children
at once to their most difficult task.
It is much easier to recognize <b>Hiawatha</b>
and <b>arrow</b>, because they are long and
different, and seem hard, than to name
promptly the elusive <b>can</b>, <b>ran</b>, and <b>tan</b>,
which seem so easy and yet are so nearly
alike as to be formidable obstacles to the
success of the untrained observer. The
climax of objection is reached when we
cite the tendency to make sentences
solely for the sake of using certain words,
thus destroying the element of thought
value in the sentence. “Does the fat
rat see the cat on the mat?” is far more
difficult for a child than is “Hiawatha
lived in a wigwam with old Nokomis”—for
the reasons above named.</p>

<p>The mastery of words is an essential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
element in learning to read. Our common
mistake is, not that we do such
work too well, but that we make it the
final aim of the reading lesson, and lead
the children to feel that they can read
when they are merely able to pronounce
words. Perhaps lack of careful attention
to the form of words is quite as
serious a mistake, for it results in carelessness
in reading.</p>

<p>The study of form and of sound should
be associated, but attention to sound
alone should precede any attempt to
master the form as suggesting sound.
Children should be taught to recognize
and to distinguish sounds, to repeat
them accurately, to speak them distinctly,
before they are taught to copy
the single characters which represent
these sounds. To hear, to repeat, to
compare, to distinguish sounds, should
be the order of the instruction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Careless speech and indistinct articulation
often arise from imperfect hearing,
or indifferent attention to what is said.
Children should be trained in the early
lessons to hear, and to repeat, <em>exactly
what is said</em>. The repetition is a test of
the child’s hearing. Begin with short
sentences. Speak them clearly, in a
moderate voice, requiring the children
to repeat after <em>once</em> hearing. Gradually
increase the length of sentence, but do
not increase the volume of voice; speak
distinctly, and expect the children to be
attentive enough to hear an ordinary
tone; teach them to respond in the same
tone, with clear articulation. Continue
this exercise until a long sentence can
be accurately returned; then pronounce
lists of words beginning with letters
which demand careful articulation. When
these have been mastered, draw attention
to initial sounds, and then to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
letters which represent them. Work
with these until every letter suggests its
sounds to the pupils, whether in a new
or in a familiar word. With little children,
the sound should be taught first in
connection with initial letters always.</p>

<p>A successful device consists in allowing
each pupil to represent a certain sound.
If the sound is the initial sound in his
own name, it will be easy for the children
to remember. Thus—John can always
suggest the sound of <b>j</b>, Mary the
sound of <b>m</b>, Peter the sound of <b>p</b>, and
so on. A class of children aided in this
way will master the sounds of the letters
in a very short time.</p>

<p>Having learned, through the initials,
the sounds which various letters represent,
the next step will be to analyze
monosyllables into their sounds. Select
first those containing short vowels, in
order to avoid the difficulty of the silent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
letter. The preliminary drill with the
initials will have made this step an easy
one to take.</p>

<p>Whenever a type word is represented,
as <b>black</b>, for example, the children
should be taught to suggest other words
which rhyme with the pattern, as <b>crack</b>,
<b>back</b>, <b>lack</b>, etc. If in every such case the
common element is studied and mastered,
in a few weeks the children will become
possessors of a large vocabulary, whose
basis is the few familiar words which
they have studied. Every type word
will stand for a list of words similar in
form.</p>

<p>This study of sounds should continue
through at least the first five school
years. After analyzing any word into
its separate sounds, the children should
be required to name other known words
which resemble the one studied. This
will tend to a habit of classification, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
will enable the pupil to depend upon
himself in his study.</p>

<p>Diacritical marks are a help in mastering
new words, if the key words have
been studied in connection with the
marks. They are needed also in consulting
the dictionary for pronunciation.
They should be taught only when necessary
to the pronunciation. In older
classes, after the use of the dictionary
becomes necessary, a complete list should
be mastered. It is a mistake to insist
upon diacritical marking when the children
can pronounce accurately without.
I remember hearing a teacher chide a
pupil for reading a sentence before she
had time to mark the vowels, but, since
the child could and did read without such
help, the marking was evidently unnecessary.
It serves as a means to an end, and
should be dispensed with when the end
can be reached without such artificial aid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>As a matter of fact, every child refers
a new word back to a similar word with
which he has become familiar. Thus:
<b>black</b>, once mastered, serves as a key to
<b>sack</b>, <b>crack</b>, <b>quack</b>, etc. The only elements
in these words are the final element
<b>ack</b> and the initial sounds. If a
child hesitates with a new word, help
him to refer at once to the type word
which he has already mastered. Instead
of pronouncing the new word for him,
insist upon his using for himself his own
stock of knowledge. Help him only
where he cannot help himself. If he
forms the habit of referring the unknown
to the kindred known, he will become
independent in study. For example, to a
six-years-old child the word <b>blacksmith</b>
may, at first sight, appear formidable.
Separated into its parts and referred to
the simple words already mastered, the
child conquers the newcomer, and adds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
it to his list of servants. He is endowed
with new strength, because he has mastered
something which seemed to him
hard. Such conquests, often repeated,
lead to strength and independence. In
many cases, it is wise to leave a child to
wrestle with a word which at first sight
he fails to master. Of course this process
is unwise if he has no experience to
which he can refer for help. Guess-work
will never take the place of thought, and
a child should not be driven to guess at
the pronunciation, but every attempt
should be based upon something which
he has been taught in former lessons.
Such practice will lead to thoughtful
self-help.</p>

<p>This work may be facilitated by many
devices. We have seen classes hunting
for new words beginning with a given
sound, as eagerly as if they were playing
hide-and-seek. Or with the utmost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
enjoyment they have made lists of
words beginning with chosen sounds; or
matched pairs of words which rhymed.
But their most valuable exercise is that
in which the old familiar word of their
first vocabulary is made the key which
unlocks the new.</p>

<p>Now, when a new word is presented,
the teacher no longer pronounces it for
the children, but asks instead, “What
word helps you to pronounce it?”
<b>Bright</b> is not a new word, because the
children know <b>light</b>, remember the sound
of <b>br</b>, and put their two bits of knowledge
together to meet the new emergency.
They do for themselves what
the teacher has heretofore done for
them.</p>

<p>A most helpful form of word study,
which is suitable for desk work, is making
lists of words containing the same
sound. It strengthens the habit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
classification, and helps in spelling and
in the recognition of new words.</p>

<p>The most difficult work for children
appears in words which are spelled alike
and pronounced differently, or in words
pronounced alike and spelled differently,
or in the various equivalents of the same
sound which our language affords. <b>Chair</b>,
<b>their</b>, <b>where</b>, etc., suggest the problems
of this nature. This work should be introduced
not earlier than the third or
fourth year. It should come in connection
with the spelling lesson, and not
with the reading. The mastery of these
difficulties in English spelling doubtless
requires many months of careful teaching.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that children
are hindered and not helped by any attempt
to spell, by sound, words which
are unique in spelling. <b>Through</b>, for
example, should be learned by sight, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
not by sound. <b>Beautiful</b>, <b>tongue</b>, <b>physique</b>,
may illustrate this group. The
eye and not the ear must be depended
upon in the mastery of such words. Care
should be taken to develop the habit of
accurate attention through the eye as
well as the ear. Any attempt to mark
the sounds in these words increases the
labor without increasing facility. If the
teacher makes a careful classification of
the ordinary words which frequently recur
in the reading lesson, she will discover
the class which must be mastered
by sight. Out of the remainder she can
make lists which include the ordinary
type sounds. The study of these lists
will reduce the labor of word mastery to
its minimum, and the habit of comparison
developed through this study will go
far to make the children independent in
the pronunciation of new words.</p>

<p>It is self-evident that this plan can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
pursued only when the words are amenable
to common phonic laws. <b>Cough</b>,
and its congeners, should be named as
new wholes. So with all words which
follow no rule, and must be pronounced
by substitution. No time should be
lost by attempting a method which has
no excuse for being, in such cases. In
its place, as a help to the mastery of
groups of kindred words, it is invaluable.
Out of place, it is bad.</p>

<p>For diacritical marks and correct pronunciation,
the teacher is referred to the
standard dictionaries. It should not be
forgotten that the teacher’s pronunciation
is a guide to the pupil. She needs
a quick ear and the careful judgment
which will render her a safe guide. The
familiar rule should direct her practice:
When in doubt, consult the dictionary.</p>

<p>Note the value of this word mastery.
The pupil fast becomes independent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the teacher, and ready to master the
page for himself. Note, also, that this
power becomes his in proportion to the
teacher’s purpose to make him self-helpful,
and her skill in finding the connecting
link between the new knowledge and
the old.</p>

<p>Two elements of learning to read have
been presented here: sentence reading
and word mastery. Of the study of the
meaning of the words and the development
of the power of imagination we
shall speak elsewhere.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE STUDY OF THE LESSON.</span></h2>

<p>In our emphasis of certain phases of
the new education, there is a tendency
to swing away from the use of
the text-book, so that the children depend
largely upon the teacher’s oral instruction
and explanation. It often
happens that the teacher, in her zeal,
forgets that the growth of the children
depends upon their own doing, and imagines
that her thought and experience
will suffice, without effort on the part of
her pupils. This state of affairs exists
in the reading class oftener than in any
other. Time is often wasted in smoothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
out difficulties which never existed
as such to the children, and obstacles
are explained away before they are
recognized by the child as obstacles.
Meanwhile the teacher is doing the
work and the pupil is losing the opportunity
to gain power by wrestling with
his little problems himself.</p>

<p>It is essential that even the little children
should be taught how to study to
the limit of their ability. The study of
the reading lesson may be made a most
profitable exercise. Too much of the
occupation termed study by both pupil
and teacher is an indifferent conning of
the book, a careless and hurried repetition
of the text, or a thoughtless copying;
all of which weakens the power of
attention, and tends to make the lesson
dull and uninteresting. Such loss
should be prevented by careful direction
of the young student. The study<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
should be at first conducted under the
personal guidance of the teacher, for,
until the children grow into the power
of learning to work by themselves, they
need to be taught how to study as well
as how to read. The time spent in the
preparation of the lesson should be
thoughtfully employed, the exercise resulting
in helpful habits as well as in
increased power.</p>

<p>Before we can teach our pupils how
to study their reading lessons, we must
have a realizing sense of their difficulties
in reading. This means that we
must know our children as well as we
would have them know their lesson. A
successful teacher of little children once
told the writer that she allowed her pupils
a period for free conversation every
day. While they availed themselves of
this privilege, she listened, in order to
discover in what they were interested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and about what subjects they talked
freely to one another. Having learned
this, she began her language lessons
where the children’s interest was centred,
led them gradually to new interests,
and helped them to overcome their
limitations.</p>

<p>Some such study of individual children,
or at least of the varying classes of
children, is indispensable to the teacher
who would endeavor to train her pupils
to overcome the obstacles in their way.
It is vain for her to assume that all
classes are alike, and that a mastery of
the words at the head of the lesson will
properly equip them all for the feat of
rendering the thought which the lesson
contains. Such easy assumption ends
in failure. The children differ in attainment
and in experience. We cannot
take for granted either knowledge or
ignorance on their part. We must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
study their experience in order to know
their limitations and their needs.</p>

<p>A class of children of foreign parentage
was engaged in reading a fairy tale
which described the adventures of a wee
robin on his way to sing a Yule song to
the king. Evidently the children were
not accustomed to imaginative tales,
and, moreover, they had the dimmest
possible notions of the wee robin, the
gray, greedy hawk, the Yule song, and
the king. Their reading was dull, monotonous,
and indifferent, accomplished
by dint of constant suggestion and explanation
on the part of the teacher,
and wearisome though patient repetition
on the part of the children.</p>

<p>The exercise, though termed reading,
was in reality simply a preparation for
reading. It would have been greatly
improved by a conscious recognition of
its import by both teacher and pupils.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
They were studying the lesson together
and aloud. Had it been thoughtfully
studied in this way before reading was
attempted, both exercises would have
been more helpful to the pupils.</p>

<p>This same class was afterwards questioned
in regard to home reading. Not
one pupil was accustomed to read or to
hear reading at home. In few homes
were there any books, while story-telling
was a practice of which they had
never dreamed. Obviously these children
had in their home experience a
meagre preparation for reading, and the
teacher’s duty was consequently a
double one. In such an instance the
reading lesson would be entirely robbed
of its value if the proper study of the
lesson were omitted.</p>

<p>For preliminary study, therefore, it is
well for the teacher to use the period
assigned to reading in talking with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
class about the lesson, her object being
not to tell what she knows, but to discover
what the children know or do not
know. To this end she will bend a listening
ear to all mistakes, not to waive
them away, nor to smile at the awkward
interpretation, but to see from what
limitation they arise. Knowing their
source, she can help to correct them by
removing the cause. Such attention to
the errors or the questions of the children
discloses two classes of difficulties:
those which the children can overcome
by thought or by observation, and
others in which the teacher must of necessity
furnish the necessary explanation.
For example, a class in a primary
school read, and with fair expression,
the story of “a kid upon the roof of a
house that railed at a wolf passing by.”
The teacher, knowing her class, assumed
their ignorance of the meaning of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
“railed”—was not surprised at the suggestion
that “the kid fired a rail at the
wolf”—and by her explanation made
clear the meaning of the word. She was
surprised, however, in the course of the
study conversation, to discover that to
the majority of the class “kid” stood
for little boy. Nothing in the wording
of the fable or in the children’s experience
served to correct the impression.
Again the duty devolved upon the
teacher.</p>

<p>Obviously, in such cases the children
must depend upon the teacher. To
withhold aid at the right time is to
make the study fruitless and the children
indifferent or discouraged. On the
other hand, by means of just such united
exercises in study the children will learn
to measure their own understanding and
to point out their own limitations.</p>

<p>Fancy the class, described above, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
having been taught to study, and therefore
having wrestled alone with the fable.
Upon coming to the recitation,
some are conscious of their ignorance
and say at once, “I do not know what
‘railed’ means.” They have studied
to some purpose, have made themselves
ready for their teacher’s explanation—and
for helping themselves by means
of the dictionary. The other difficulty
presented by the slang use of “kid”
would of course fail to present itself to
their consciousness.</p>

<p>One result, then, of the preliminary
study, with or without the teacher,
should be to help the children to discover
the “don’t know” line; the second
should be to enable them to help
themselves, if possible. Through careful
and conscious study, they may be
helped to realize the “sense” of what
they read, and to judge for themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
when they fail to get the meaning of the
sentence.</p>

<p>From the beginning, the children
should be shown that every sentence
is an embodiment of a thought, every
word having its place in the expression
of that thought.</p>

<p>“A saucy robin is eating the ripe
cherries in the tree under my window,”
the children read. The teacher studies
with them for a moment. What does
the sentence tell them? Who is eating
the ripe cherries? What kind of robin?
What is he doing? What is he eating?
What cherries is he eating? Where is
the tree? What word tells us what
kind of a robin is eating? What words
tell where the cherries are? What word
tells who is eating the cherries? Even
in primary schools such questioning is
valuable, leading the children to realize
that the words appear in the sentence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
not by chance, but in order to express
something; that every word has its
work, that not one can be omitted, that
a change in a single word changes the
thought. Such exercises, thoughtfully
conducted, will lead the children to look
for the thought in the sentence, and will
make its mastery a test of their success.
If the sentence does not yield them a
thought which they understand, let
them question every word until they
get its meaning. Thus they learn to
recognize the line where their knowledge
ends and their ignorance begins.</p>

<p>It is often the case, however, that the
difficulty to be overcome is the pupils’
inability to pronounce words whose
meaning may be familiar. If this is the
case, they will need to bring all their
knowledge of words to bear upon this
new problem. “Sidewalk” is a long
word, a new word—no one knows it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
The teacher helps, not by pronouncing
it and easing the children of their load.
No. She says: “That word seems
long, but it is very easy. You know
the first syllable.” Yes, everybody
knows “side.” “Now, who knows the
second? Who can put them together?”
The children rejoice in the sense
of overcoming. They have gained some
power to help themselves. Our teaching
should compel as well as invite such
thoughtful comparison of the old with
the new, should lead the children to use
what they have learned, in the mastery
of the not learned.</p>

<p>The simplest lessons in preparatory
study are thus justified: they lead to a
conscious judgment of one’s attainment.
Study means nothing if it does not lead
to this judgment. The power once
gained, the pupil is his own best teacher,
his own strongest helper. Prize,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
then, all exercises which lead to this
judgment. Instead of saying to the untrained
pupil, “Read your lesson ten
times,” when his present attainment or
lack of attainment renders such repetition
worse than useless, you will say,
“Read the lesson and copy all the
words whose meaning you do not
know.” “Read and copy the words
that you cannot pronounce.” “Read
and copy the sentence that you do not
understand.” “Read so carefully that
you are sure you can read well to the
class.”</p>

<p>The skilful teacher will think of a
hundred devices to advance such study.
The test of each device will be, “Does
it help to arouse thought? Does it end
in thoughtful study?”</p>

<p>Such study is necessary before reading
whenever we may assume that the lesson
presents any difficulty to the child, unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
we prefer that the first oral rendering
of the lesson shall be merely a
studying aloud.</p>

<p>As a stimulus to, or a test of, study, it
may be well to omit the oral reading occasionally,
substituting for it an exercise
in silent reading, whose thoroughness is
tested by questions. After the usual
study of the lesson the books are closed
and the teacher calls upon the pupils to
tell her what they have read. Older
pupils may respond by giving the substance
of the lesson. Younger children
may be tested by more frequent and detailed
questions after the reading of short
paragraphs.</p>

<p>The above exercise is even more helpful
if the children share in the questioning.
They read with keener interest if
their knowledge is thus put to the test.</p>

<p>Such exercises tend to emphasize to
the pupils the truth that their reading is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
not for itself, but to make them masters
of the thoughts expressed in their lessons.
It becomes more real, more purposeful,
in proportion as this is realized.</p>

<p>In this connection, it may be said
that anything which adds purpose to
the reading lesson gives motive to study.
When pupils are asked to read to the
class some selection unknown to the
other pupils, they study and read with
a zest quite unlike that manifested in
the repetition of a worn-out selection
which the others already know. For
some good end, recognized by himself
as worthy, the child reads now. The
introduction of opportunities for individual
reading, as early as may be, thus
proves an incentive to study and a
means of rapid advancement. Cuttings
from papers and magazines and collections
of children’s books prove most
helpful at this stage, affording a prize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
for attainment, as well as an evident test
of progress.</p>

<p>The foregoing has been written with
special reference to beginners in reading.
As pupils advance in their grades, the
study of the reading becomes even more
necessary and may be made the more
profitable.</p>

<p>All that has been said of younger
readers applies equally to older pupils.
The test of the ability to study is the
power to judge rightly where the limit
of one’s knowledge appears.</p>

<p>As soon as the pupil can point out
the obstacle which hinders his understanding,
he is ready to be taught. A
single word, a question, a suggestion
from the teacher, removes his difficulty.
He recognizes his need and desires help,—therefore
listens attentively and intelligently.</p>

<p>At this stage he is enabled, also, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
help himself, since he is prepared to
use the dictionary and other reference
books.</p>

<p>Older students should read with the
help of the dictionary. They should, of
course, be taught how to use it, just as
they are taught to interpret any other
book. Its use is discussed at length in
another chapter.</p>

<span class="smaller">LANGUAGE LESSONS AS A PREPARATION
FOR READING LESSONS.</span></h2>

<p>Two problems confront the teacher
of little children in the ordinary
school-room. Children coming from different
homes, with various training and
environment, do not always bring a common
fund of knowledge. Unaccustomed
to the strange surroundings and the new
<i lang="fr">régime</i>, they are not always free in telling
what they know. The teacher needs to
learn the “contents of their minds” (as
the present phrase hath it), and this she
cannot readily do unless the children
converse freely and without self-consciousness.
Talking lessons, or lessons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
whose object is purely to help them to
free expression, so that they will reveal
their experiences to the teacher, are
very necessary at this stage. These lessons
will have a further value if they
help the children to new interests, and to
new knowledge. They will also be more
valuable if the teacher recognizes a definite
purpose and forms a definite plan
for the lesson.</p>

<p>Again, the simplest reading lesson develops
the fact that, inasmuch as the
children’s experiences have been varied,
their corresponding fund of ideas is
widely different. Any new lesson may
present ideas entirely foreign to the experience
of the children. The words
which represent these ideas, therefore,
will be unfamiliar. This state of affairs
necessitates an act of teaching which
should precede the act of reading. For
example, a class of city children in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
West attempt to read a story which
deals with life by the sea. The sounding
sea, the rolling waves, the whispering
foam, the rugged rocks, the shining
sands, the smooth pebbles, the brown
seaweed, the white-winged ships, the
brave sailors, are unknown quantities to
these children—entirely foreign to their
experience. Clearly, before they read
this lesson, they must know something
of the life and scenes which the lesson
portrays. The teacher of children who
live by the sea is not confronted by
the same problem. Her children have
played upon the beach, have gathered
the many-colored pebbles, have built
houses in the wet sand. Ships at sea
are as familiar to them as are the clouds,
or the birds; while many of them have
played upon the decks of their fathers’
fishing-boats, and know the ropes and
spars even as they know their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
homes. These children have had an
experience which fills the lesson with
meaning. The inland children must be
taught in the next best way. Since
they cannot go to the sea, at least
pictures of the sea may be brought
to them. Shells and pebbles, sea-urchins,
starfishes, and seaweeds will
tell their story of the far-off beaches.
Pictures of ships at sea, of rocks lashed
by the waves in a storm, will help them
to imagine the conditions which their
lesson attempts to describe to them.
But the wise teacher will make a connecting
link, in some fashion, between
the experience and interest of the child
and the thought suggested by the story.
Here, then, is the need of a language
lesson which shall introduce or explain
the reading lesson, preparing the child
for the new thought, or recalling to his
mind the almost forgotten experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>The everyday experience in every
city school-room will serve to reënforce
this truth. Many a city child has never
looked upon daisies and buttercups.
Brooks and fields and trees are outside
his little horizon. It is idle to have
these children pronounce the words
which stand for these objects unless the
words call up pictures in their own
minds, and this cannot be the case except
as they have some experience with
the real things. It is not impossible to
bring the flowers and the birds and the
trees within the experience of the children.
No other work which we can ever
do for them will tend more to their future
happiness and growth; but, aside
from that, no other work which we can
do for them will contribute so generously
to their growth in reading power. They
cannot get the thought from the page
unless the words stand for something at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
least akin to their own experience, and
our first efforts must begin by occasioning
the experience which is necessary to
the interpretation of the printed page.
As a means to good reading, then, language
lessons are necessary for the purpose
of developing ease of expression
and freedom from self-consciousness, and
leading to knowledge which will serve
as a basis for the new thought contained
in the lesson.</p>

<p>The subjects introduced in the earliest
language lessons should be those with
which children are ordinarily familiar.
All country children are somewhat acquainted
with the common animals: the
rabbit, squirrel, cat, dog, cow, mouse,
etc. They know something of the occupations
of the people around them.
They have watched the sunrise and sunset.
They have seen the boughs of the
trees waving in the wind. They have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
been awakened by the birds in the morning.
They have cared for pet animals
at home. Many city children have had
something of this experience. All need
to have it. In every lesson where these
subjects are introduced, the teacher
should be assured that the children already
know something about them. A
short conversation may suffice where
the objects are already familiar; where
they are strange, careful lessons should
be arranged. The cat, rabbit, dog,
squirrel, or mouse, can be brought to
the school-room, cared for, observed,
studied, discussed. These language lessons
will not only give the children the
knowledge necessary for understanding
the lessons, but they will endow the
subject with new interest, and add to the
reading a sense of reality. Children who
have been observing the squirrel will
read with great zest the lessons which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
reaffirm what their eyes have seen, or
answer the questions which they have
asked, or tell some story which adds to
the interest already evoked. The reading
thus becomes an expression of the
child’s actual experience or interest.
It is no longer a something which he
does simply because he is told. He
sees at once the fruit of his labors. He
reaches a goal which seems desirable
from a child’s point of view. He recognizes
the purpose and meaning of the
story, and works to dig out the message
which the sentences contain for him.
Everything which serves to make the
lesson real to the child’s experience,
makes a permanent addition to his reading
power.</p>

<p>A little careful study convinces us
that there are two general fields which
all readers must explore. The subjects
which appear and reappear upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
pages of books have their source either
in nature or in human experience.
When we teach the child to read books,
we must also teach him to apprehend
that of which books treat. This teaching
will necessarily include observation
of nature and observation of human experience.
To read “The Village Blacksmith”
requires some knowledge of a
blacksmith’s work and its associations:
the horse and his shoes, the molten iron
and its action, the sounding anvil and its
use, the reason for the “honest sweat”
upon the brow of him who “owes not
any man.” Knowledge of nature and
knowledge of human experience are
surely needed in order to read the
thought in this poem. He whose experience
is richest will obtain the richest
harvest from this field. Any act of
reading will teach us this truth with regard
to our own experience. It ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
also to point the way for all teaching
of children. A visit to a blacksmith’s
shop is the best possible preparation for
a study of “The Village Blacksmith.”
If such a visit is impossible (is it ever
impossible?), pictures and talks may help
to supply the need. The language lesson
in the one form or the other is necessary
to the full interpretation of the
reading. So of any poem or story which
tells of the life of the farmer, the miller,
the baker, the sailor, the fisherman, the
shoemaker, the mother. The language
lesson which serves to make the experience
real to the children helps them to
understand the reading lesson, and gives
added power for the interpretation of
all such lessons in the future.</p>

<p>Such language lessons should not be
considered as something added to the
school course. They are legitimate
reading lessons, inasmuch as they prepare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
for the study of pages which would
be meaningless to many pupils without
such preparation. The teacher will of
course choose her own time for such lessons.
Often they are given in connection
with the reading lesson itself. A
wiser plan ordinarily is that which allots
a specific time for the observation or
the conversation which is necessary to
explain the reading lesson. If the first
period of the morning is set aside for
oral language, the subjects for this period
may be easily determined by the
reading lesson, and selected to accord
with and prepare for it.</p>

<p>A few illustrative lessons appear in
another chapter. They are intended to
serve as suggestions merely, for those
to whom such lessons are to open a new
field. It is believed that in the majority
of school-rooms such teaching is already
a common feature.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="smaller">EXPRESSION IN READING.</span></h2>

<p>How can children be taught to read
aloud clearly, distinctly, and with
feeling, so as to clearly convey the author’s
thought and to give pleasure to
the listener? “My pupils do not read
with expression,” is a common complaint.
“How can I help them?”</p>

<p>Manifestly the first requisite to reading
with expression is the mastery of the
thought on the part of the pupil, and
this cannot be accomplished without
mastery of the words. As has been said
in another chapter, children should be
trained to study in such a way that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
can decide for themselves what words
present difficulties to their understanding.
When the pupils, after studying
a lesson, are enabled to point to the
exact words which are obstacles to their
thought-getting, the teacher’s labors are
minimized and her teaching is at once
made definite. Such study, too, leads
the pupils to more thoughtful reading.
Since they must weigh every word in
the sentence to discover its meaning,
they become accustomed to dig for the
thought, and to estimate their own difficulties.
By this means they help themselves
to the mastery of the thought, as
far as the words in which it is expressed
belong to their vocabulary.</p>

<p>But when a pupil points out to the
teacher the words which mark the boundary
of his understanding, it becomes
her duty to make them clear to him.
This is a fruitful exercise. The child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
desires to learn the meaning of the word
which has blocked his way, and his need
of it makes him its master forever after.
It is only in this way that words are
mastered. It is idle to explain a list of
words for which children have no use in
the expression of their thought. But
after the study has revealed to the child
his need of new knowledge, the word
fits at once into his vocabulary and answers
the new need. The teacher’s explanation
not only suffices to make the
reading plain, but it increases the child’s
vocabulary for future use.</p>

<p>It should be borne in mind in such
exercises that the word is not always
made plain by simple explanation; illustration
may be necessary, or some entire
language lesson like those indicated in a
previous chapter. The teacher should
make mental note at least of these unfamiliar
words, in order that she may so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
direct her language lesson as to supplement
her teaching in reading. She is
wise if she keeps a notebook at hand in
which these lists may be recorded.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the above that
the pupil is expected to master the
words of the lesson as a means of getting
the thought, before it is assumed
that he can read with expression. But,
having prepared himself through study,
and having been assisted by the teacher’s
illustration and explanation, there
should be no hindrance to free and
natural reading. We do, however, find
expression hindered by various minor
causes, some of which it may be well to
discuss.</p>

<p>A frequent occasion of indolent or
indifferent reading is the child’s feeling
that the exercise is perfunctory, one of
the tasks assigned at school as a school
duty, but having in itself no excuse for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
being. He needs to realize that he is
delivering a message, or telling a story
which some one desires to hear. It has
often been observed that children read
their own productions with marvellously
good effect, even when they stumble
and hesitate in the normal reading exercises.
The reason is easily discerned.
In the one case they have something to
tell, and desire to tell it. In the second
case, the exercise is one in which they
have no special interest. The teacher’s
chief endeavor, then, should be directed
toward inciting in the children a desire
to communicate thought. This may
sometimes be secured by having the
class listen, with closed books, while a
single pupil reads, the teacher insisting
that he shall so read that every one who
listens may understand and enjoy all
that is read. Another help which has
been suggested by many teachers is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
practice of bringing from home different
short selections, which the pupils are
encouraged to read to the class. These
selections may be brief and simple—some
anecdote, some clipping from a
newspaper, some phrase or line, some
conundrum, which has interested the
child. It will soon be discovered that
the children will learn to read well only
when conscious that their reading is the
means of conveying the thought to their
hearers.</p>

<p>The practice of consulting reference
books, even with pupils in the lowest
grammar grades, has a reflex influence
upon the power to read aloud well, since
it gives to the pupil something which he
desires to read to the others and which
he alone can convey to them. This desire
to share what is read by becoming
able to read well should be stimulated
in every possible way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>Again, ease in reading, which is an
important factor, is often prevented by
the pupil’s self-consciousness, which
renders him timid and awkward whenever
he attempts to read aloud in the
presence of others. This timid self-consciousness
varies with different individuals,
of course, and it also varies in
different classes. The teacher is often
responsible for this shrinking on the
part of the children, although it may
be an unconscious responsibility on her
part. Undue criticism of the reader,
which draws the attention of the class
to his faults and makes him conscious
of himself, often prevents the very thing
which the teacher is striving to obtain.
The pupil’s thought should be drawn
away from himself and centred upon
the thought in the sentence, the message
which he is to deliver. The question
should be directed toward that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
rather than toward the pupil’s idiosyncrasies.</p>

<p>This is coupled with another serious
consideration. It has just been said
that the child cannot read with expression
if he is thinking about himself. It
is also true that he cannot read well except
as his mind is centred upon the
subject about which he is reading. The
teacher’s efforts should be in the direction
of picturing the scene which the
child describes, so that it will become
real to him, and that he may be enabled
to paint it to the class. She not only
will endeavor to refrain from drawing
the pupil’s attention to himself by ill-chosen
comments, but she will also help
him to imagine the thing described and
to fix his thought upon it. For the
time being everything else is forgotten.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that a class is reading
“Paul Revere’s Ride”:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>If the pupil is to make his hearers
hear and see Paul Revere, he must see
and hear him, too. His eye must be
upon the belfry tower of the Old North
Church; he must feel the loneliness of
the quiet graveyard, the fearfulness of
the silent way; he must catch the gleam
of the light; must watch the impetuous
mounting, hear the hurry of hoofs in the
village street, and realize the fatefulness
of the hour in which the land is kindled
into flame. Every effort should be centred
upon helping the children to feel, to
imagine the picture, and to sense its
depth of meaning. Say nothing now
about holding the book in one hand,
standing on both feet or throwing the
shoulders back; but stir the class to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
feel as Paul Revere felt, and to tell the
tale with enthusiastic pride. Let all
the questions help to make the picture
clearer and the feeling stronger. Read
again, and again, and again, until the
message becomes most familiar, but
with every reading more eager than before.</p>

<p>This selection emphasizes the need of
preparation for the reading lesson outside
of the reading class. No one can
read the poem well who does not understand
the setting. The story of the
Revolution is essential to understanding
the poem. Why the British ships were
in the harbor; why the country folk
should be up and in arms; what preceded
and what followed the fateful
ride; the scene of the poem—the belfry,
the church, the town, the river, the
harbor—must be clearly in mind. The
background of the poet’s picture must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
be drawn before the children attempt to
read aloud the paragraph.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the picture will be
most vivid in the minds of those pupils
who are most generously endowed with
imagination. The above exercise goes
to prove the need of some attempt on
the part of teachers to cultivate the imagination
of the children. A close scrutiny
of the failures in our reading lessons
would lead us to believe that it is to a
lack of this power that we may attribute
much of our difficulty in teaching reading.
As soon as the children picture
the scene which the words describe, they
read with interest and vigor. Their indifference
and heaviness are largely due
to the fact that the words suggest no
picture to them.</p>

<p>This faculty might be developed, in
some degree, by frequent conversations
which necessitate the children’s picturing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
or imagining what they have read. The
simplest primer will lend itself to this exercise.
The habit of drawing the picture
which the sentence suggests is a further
stimulus. Reading fairy stories or stories
of adventure may help to stimulate the
imagination. An effective aid is derived
from playing or acting the story told in
the lesson. I remember seeing a primary
class that played “Hiawatha”
with great delight, different children
taking the parts of Nokomis, Hiawatha,
Wenonah, the Pine Tree, the Fir Tree,
the Squirrels, the Rabbits; reciting their
parts with eager pleasure, acting them
in the most unconscious fashion, and
never with any lack of expression. The
children recited with ease and naturalness
and vigor. They were lost in their
play, which was very real to them. Not
long ago I visited a school in which the
children had begged the privilege of representing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the dialogue which they were
reading. They assigned the parts themselves,
improvised simple costumes, and
read their various parts with great animation.
The members of the class who
served as audience listened with rapt
attention, very unlike that which is ordinarily
accorded to a rendering of the
reading lesson. Through the play, the
lesson became vitalized, it was made
real. It did not occur to the teacher to
suggest inflections or pauses; such suggestions
were quite as unnecessary as
they would have been in any conversation
with the children. These things
take care of themselves when the children
have once been overmastered by
the desire to express the thought. Nor
will it ever be necessary to dwell upon
them if this desire is created. “Seek
ye first the kingdom of God and his
righteousness, and all these things shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
be added unto you.” In a parallel
sense, if we once inspire in the children
the desire to convey the message of the
text, the accessories of inflection and
tone will become theirs. It cannot be
too strongly emphasized that these lesser
phases of good reading will be secured if
properly subordinated to one great aim—the
desire to communicate thought.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to imagine a question
at this point. “Would you not have
any vocal exercises to help in securing
expression?” By all means, but not as
a part of the reading exercise. If the
exercise shows that the children have
certain needs,—if the teeth are closed, if
the pronunciation is slovenly or the articulation
poor,—special exercises should
be planned to remedy such defects, but
these should be given as exercises and
not as a part of the reading lesson. Sentences
which demand clear articulation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
may be pronounced in rapid succession,
or sung to the scale; selections may be
read from the farthest corner of the
room. Exercises which stretch the muscles
used in articulation, exercises which
straighten the body or secure ease in
posture; breathing exercises and their
kindred,—all are helpful, <em>as exercises</em>,
but they should not interrupt the reading.
They may alternate with reading,
and prepare for it, but they should be
considered, as they really are, subordinate
to the one essential, the creation of
a desire to read.</p>

<p>“Would you ever read to children in
order to help them to get the right expression?”
is a question which is frequently
asked. By all means. There
is no other way in which children can
form an ideal of good reading. Many
children hear no reading in their homes.
They are accustomed to monotonous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
speech and to careless articulation. It
is necessary to read to them, and to read
well, in order to show them what good
reading is. A further advantage of
reading to the children is to show them
how much the teacher gets from a poem
or story which has meant little to them.
Such reading should not lead to servile
imitation on the part of the children;
rather the opposite. The teacher’s comments
upon the reading in the class will
readily fix the seal of her approval upon
individual renderings. “Let me hear
how that seems to you, John,” she will
say. “Mary, let me hear you read.
I should like to get your thought.”
“Kate, is that the way you understood
it? Let me hear you read it.” I have
heard a teacher request one pupil after
another to read, waiting until the interpretation
which was like her own was
given before she commended, and impressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
upon the entire class her feeling
that such reading alone was correct. As
a matter of fact, every rendering which
was given was as good as the teacher’s—some
even were better. The reader
must interpret the author’s message as
it appears to him. His reading shows
<em>his</em> interpretation. If the teacher reads
to the class, she shows simply what the
writer’s message has been to her. In
the reading lesson she gives to the pupils
the opportunity of expressing what they
themselves have read.</p>

<p>In reading, as in everything else, ease
comes with practice. The class should
have two varieties of practice. They
should read and re-read a few selections
which demand variety in expression;
and they should read many easy selections
which require very little effort in
mastering. If the exercise is difficult
enough to demand study, it will necessitate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
hesitation if read at sight. Such
attempts at sight reading, with too difficult
matter, will result in the habit of
stumbling. Children should have an
opportunity to overcome by study the
difficulties which would otherwise make
them hesitate in reading. All sight
reading, so called, should be easy enough
to be read fluently at sight.</p>

<p>The old-fashioned custom of setting
apart Friday afternoons for reading, recitation,
and declamation should be revived.
The exercise was admirable,
giving the children confidence in reading
and speaking which resulted in ease and
fluency. It was a helpful adjunct to the
reading class and deserves to be honored
in the observance.</p>

<p>It may be well to suggest, in this connection,
that the habit of reading with
free and individual expression is seriously
hindered by the practice of concert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
reading. If the teachers who pursue
that practice were to attempt occasionally
to read aloud in company with
others, they would discover the difficulties
under which the children labor.
The practice works in direct opposition
to the exercises which have been advised.
It is impossible for the child to
give his individual rendering in a concert
recitation. He cannot even read at
his individual rate; he must wait for his
neighbor. His words drag, his voice becomes
strained and unnatural, the exercise
assumes the school-room tone, and
the children adopt the swinging rhythm
of the singsong. A few children lead;
the others follow, or most of the others—a
very few succeed in evading the reading
altogether. All this is wrong. It is better
for the child to read once alone than
to read ten times in concert with others.
It is true, however, that there is one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
place for the concert reading. When a
poem or paragraph has been memorized
by the entire class under the direction
of the teacher, they may learn to recite
it well in concert without the disadvantages
described; but, as a reading lesson,
the exercise has no place—it should
be banished from the school-room.</p>

<p>One word more. In our attempts to
teach children to read with expression,
we may be helped by studying to learn
what selections they like best to read,
what it is that appeals to them. By following
the line of their interest we may
come to realize why selections which we
have chosen are difficult for them, and
through making a wiser choice may become
more successful in our teaching.
Here, as elsewhere, it is the intelligent
study of the class by the teacher which
enables her to apply her knowledge of
the subject which she teaches.</p>

with the corresponding parts of those
animals.</p>

<p>Describe the horns. Why do cows
have horns? What use do they make
of them?</p>

<p>Describe the ears. Where are they?
Does the cow move them? The ears
of the dog, cat, cow, horse are movable;
ours are not. Why?</p>

<p>Compare the cow’s nose and mouth
with those of the cat or the horse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>Does anyone know anything about
the cow’s teeth? What does she
eat? What kind of teeth does she
need?</p>

<p>Tell the children about the chewing
of the cud.</p>

<p>Of what use to the cow is the long tail
with its brush at the end? Who has
seen her use it? Would a short tail
serve as well?</p>

<p>Who knows anything about the cow’s
foot? Who can draw a picture of a
cow’s footprint?</p>

<p>Of what use are cows to us? What
does the cow give to us?</p>

<p>How should cows be cared for? What
kind of stall, what kind of bed, what
food, water, pasture, should they have?
Describe a pasture that you would like
if you were a cow. Describe a barn
that you would like if you were a
cow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>How ought we to treat animals? Is
it right to forget their wants when we
have the care of them?</p>

<p>Every lesson upon animals should help
the children to realize more fully their
obligation to properly care for them.
Sympathy for animal life ought to be
developed through the reading and language
lessons. Interest in animal life
is always present in children. The
questions above suggested cannot be
answered at once, by any ordinary class
of children. Many who are familiar
with cows in general will be unable to
answer them definitely. But the questions
will lead them to more thoughtful
observation, after which they can
report in another lesson. Sometimes
the subjects may be distributed, different
groups of children being held
responsible for the answer to a certain
question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>2. <i>Direct outside observation, in order to get
new knowledge.</i></p>

<p>It is entirely feasible, in many school-rooms,
to make the study of the cow the
subject of a field lesson. The children
may be taken, in groups, to a farmyard,
a pasture, or a stable, where a cow may
be observed and studied. Such lessons
have ceased to be formidable, since they
have become so common. The need of
these visits is revealed by the children’s
vague answers. Nothing but definite
observation of the real thing will open
their eyes, and make the words in their
lesson full of meaning.</p>

<p>There are many city children who
have never seen a cow. If it is impossible
to take them to a real cow, excellent
pictures should be substituted. Many
of the questions suggested could be answered
by pictures. It must be remembered,
however, that the picture tells to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
us, who have had the real experience,
much more than it tells to a child who
has never had that experience. It is not
strange that a boy who has never seen
a real cow should imagine that animal to
be six inches long, the size of the cow
which he has known from pictures in the
lesson. Emphasize the fact of the size.
Allude to the picture as a picture only.
Have the children show by their hands
how high a cow would be, how long,
how wide its head, etc. By such means,
help to vivify the mental picture which
is suggested to the children by the
lesson. If the pictures are the only
avenue through which they learn about
the cow, do not attempt to give as much
information as would naturally be associated
with the real observation lesson,
Remember that the amount of knowledge
which the child gains is not proportioned
to the number of facts which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the teacher enumerates. He will intelligently
appropriate those which his observation
and thought have helped him
to understand. As has been said before,
this truth determines the value of
the reading lesson to the child, and necessitates
the associated lessons, which
supplement his experience and enable
him to bring to the lesson a mind furnished
with appropriate ideas.</p>

<p>3. <i>Tell the children simple facts which they
cannot find out for themselves.</i></p>

<p>There are many facts associated with
the cow which the children can know
only through others: the use of the
horns, of the bones, the hair, etc.; the
manufactures; the reason for the cud-chewing;
the making of butter and
cheese. The writer has known class-rooms
in which milk was skimmed, the
cream churned into butter, and the butter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
eaten by the children. The quantity,
of course, was small, but the process
was very real and very interesting.
This happened recently in a kindergarten
in a large city. There were only
three children in the class who had ever
seen a cow. It is hardly necessary to
say that the lesson followed a visit to
the cow.</p>

<p>4. <i>Reënforce the lessons by stories.</i></p>

<p>Stories about cows, or descriptions of
certain animals, perhaps the pets which
we have known, will add interest to the
lessons.</p>

<p>5. <i>Collect pictures of cows, for comparison
and description.</i></p>

<p>In almost any district the children will
be able to help in making collections of
pictures which illustrate the language
and reading lesson. These pictures can
be obtained from newspapers, magazines,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
advertisements, and various other
sources. Every child who helps to swell
the collection will feel an added interest
in it. The collection will be valuable in
proportion as it is carefully arranged and
thoughtfully used by the teacher. If
the cards are neatly mounted upon separate
sheets which contain the name of
the contributor, and distributed amongst
the children for observation and comparison,
it will prove really helpful.
Through the comparison of the different
pictures many facts will be developed,
suggested by the children’s comments
or questions. Such teaching will be
sure to fit the need of the children.</p>

<p>These suggestions will be modified
and arranged by any teacher who desires
to use them. They may help to point
the way for those who are not entirely
familiar with this phase of their work,
and so lead to better things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<h3>II.—<i>Lesson upon the Oak.</i></h3>

<p>As in the previous lesson, the teacher’s
first object should be to discover
what the children already know. Nearly
all children, even those living in the
midst of the city, have some opportunity
to see and study trees, and their
attention should be carefully directed
to the trees in their neighborhood.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen an oak tree?
Where was it growing? How tall was
it? (Compare with a man, with a horse,
a house, with other trees.)</p>

<p>What do you remember about the
size of its trunk? about the bark, about
the leaves, about the fruit?</p>

<p>Bring to the class acorns, leaves, or,
in blossom time, bring blossoms. What
is the use of the blossom, of the leaf, of
the acorn? Draw them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>Plant an acorn and see what comes of
it.</p>

<p>Of what use is the oak tree to us?
(Do not forget that beauty as well as
manufacturing is to be considered.)</p>

<p>Name articles made of oak.</p>

<p>Bring specimens of the wood.</p>

<p>The older pupils can draw the tree.</p>

<p>Tell the children about the Charter
Oak.</p>

<p>Take them, if possible, to a field or
woods or park or street where they can
see an oak tree growing.</p>

<p>Refer to the lesson some weeks afterwards,
in order to lead to continued
observation of the tree in different
stages.</p>

<p>Do not feel that it is necessary to do
all which the lesson suggests, with every
class; but be sure that the children have
some actual knowledge of a real oak
tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<h3>III.—<i>Lessons upon Occupations.</i></h3>

<p>Frequent reference is made, in all literature,
to the occupations of men.
Even if this were not so, a knowledge
of these occupations is necessary to even
a fair education. Every child should be
intelligent in regard to the work of the
farmer, the miller, the carpenter, the
brick-layer, the engineer, the miner, the
merchant. But, be this as it may, the
pages of the school reader, even, will
demand some knowledge of the everyday
occupations of men.</p>

<p>Children are naturally interested in the
occupations of their neighbors. They
like to see things made. They like to
know why certain effects come from certain
causes. Nothing could be more
fruitful than a visit to a blacksmith shop,
a new house that is being built, a sewer
that is being dug, a cellar that is being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
laid; to a ropewalk, to a mine, to a
quarry, where real men are engaged in
real work. This natural interest of children
in these subjects is evidenced by
their desire to “play” the miller, the
farmer, the driver, the boatman, etc.
We do well when we build upon this
natural interest. “The Village Blacksmith”
is a familiar poem, based upon a
common experience. As has been said,
the children who know something about
the work of the blacksmith will enjoy
and understand the poem as no others
can. Ask them to go to a blacksmith,
and then to report; or go with a class of
children, and help them to observe and
to question. The blacksmith will be
helpful and generous if he is courteously
requested to give his aid to the
children. Prepare them for the lesson
by a preliminary talk about the blacksmith,
his work, the need of his work;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
his tools, the material with which he
works; the source from which iron is
obtained, the process by which steel is
made. Having prepared the children to
observe, assign questions or topics upon
which they are to report: the anvil, the
forge, the sledge, the bellows, the horseshoe,
etc. Upon returning from the visit,
allow the different pupils to tell what
they have seen. After the general conversation,
insist upon an orderly description.</p>

<p>Kindred lessons may be given upon
the other occupations suggested. In
many cases, stories can be told, or read,
which will reënforce the observation.
It must not be forgotten that one result
of the lessons should be a sincere respect
for honest toil, and sturdy pride in
ability to do honest work well. It is
hardly necessary to say that the visit to
the blacksmith’s shop will reënforce the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
reading, and that a study of Longfellow’s
poem will in turn make the visit
more valuable. The language lesson
will help the reading lesson because it
adds interest; it will also help the lesson
as literature, because it gives fuller
power of interpretation, and corresponding
appreciation of the poem. All these
lessons will be made more valuable by
the use of collections of pictures.</p>

<h3>IV.—<i>Rain.</i></h3>

<p class="center">For Second Grade.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Observation during a Rainfall.</i></p>

<p>What is rain?</p>

<p>Where does it come from?</p>

<p>How did it get there?</p>

interested in the question, but do
not answer it for them now; let them
question and think.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon which windows does it fall?</p>

<p>Why not upon the opposite windows?</p>

<p>Where does it go?</p>

<p>What good will it do?</p>

<p>What harm will it do?</p>

<p>Think what the rain does for the
trees.</p>

<p>Would it make any difference to you?</p>

<span class="smaller">LESSONS TO SUGGEST PLANS OF WORK—CONTINUED.</span></h2>

<h3>I.—<i>Lessons on Bird Life.</i></h3>

<p>The study of birds has become so
common as a part of school work,
that suggestions upon the subject may
be trite and superfluous. For the teachers
who have not yet attempted such
study, the following practical suggestions
may be helpful.</p>

<p>All children are interested in animal
life, but few city children have more
than a vague notion of the habits and
characteristics of the animals of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
they read. Not long ago, the writer
chanced to hear a class of primary children
reading about the hen. The exercise
was hesitating, the reading dubious.
Upon questioning it transpired that but
three children in the class had ever seen
a live hen, and in two of these cases the
hen was “nailed up in a box in the
market.” One child only had seen a
hen walking about, and that was in
“Tim Jones’s Alley.” Obviously the
sentences which had seemed so luminous
to the teacher were dark to the
children.</p>

<p>Such experiences are not confined to
city children. Wide experience has discovered
many a country child whose
eyes have never been truly opened to
the life about him. It is safe to assume
that any class of little children will profit
by the lesson which increases their interest
in the bird world, and opens their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
eyes to see new beauties, their minds
to receive new pictures, and which incidentally
explains the pages that otherwise
are meaningless.</p>

<p>For such preliminary study, the best
beginning is the observation of some
caged bird which can be kept within
reach for awhile. A canary, a parrot,
a dove, a hen, a duck will behave well
in the school-room, may be cared for by
the pupils, and observed for several days,
and will serve as a centre from which
new investigation may radiate, or a type
to which all new bird knowledge may be
referred. The canary or parrot will be
brought in its own house. For the
others a dwelling-place may be extemporized.
A box frame may be built,
open on all sides, and covered with
coarse wire netting or netted fencing;
or one side may be removed from a
wooden box of suitable size, and netting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
be substituted for it. The children
should be able to watch the bird as it
eats, drinks, walks, or flies about, and
should at first be allowed to observe
without the restriction of question or
recitation.</p>

<p>The conversation of the pupils, their
exclamations and questions, will reveal
the best line of approach to the subject.
It will be found that their chief interest
centres in the actions of the bird. “See
him eat! How fast he turns the seed.
See the shells fly! How he spatters the
water! Oh, he’s washing himself!”
Such are the free comments of the children.
Let these determine the first lesson.</p>

<p>“You have been watching the canary.
What have you seen him do? What
can he do that you can do? What can
he do that you can<em>not</em> do?”</p>

<p>These questions cannot be answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
without actual knowledge. If the replies
are written upon the board, it will
be discovered that the children have
added definitely to their store of knowledge,
and likewise to their vocabulary.</p>

<p>Another conversation may compare
the cat and the canary, the cow and the
canary, or (a very different exercise) may
note the resemblances and differences
between the canary and other birds with
which the children are somewhat familiar.
This comparison leads to observation
of the structure, to naming and
describing the parts of the canary.</p>

<p>“The canary can fly because he has
wings. We have no wings, but we have
arms. The cat has no wings, but she
has two forelegs.” So the comparison
proceeds to head, eyes, bill, feet, until
the children are able to describe the
bird in clear and appropriate language.</p>

<p>Another talk compares the habits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
the bird with those of the cat or dog,
and leads to descriptions of the nests,
the eggs, the home habits of the bird,
with the rearing of the young. The lessons
prepare for the reading, to be sure,
but this value is incidental only, as compared
with the widened interest and
growing power of the children in thinking,
seeing, and saying.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to keep a record
of the words used, or needed, by
the children in such lessons, to collate
them afterward, and to discover what
proportion of the list of words is included
in the ordinary stock vocabulary
of elementary readers. Such a study
would reveal to any intelligent teacher
the close relation between experience
and reading, and would fully justify
the plan of work outlined in these
pages.</p>

<p>It may be well to add in passing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
such a series of lessons serves as a basis
to which all the related lessons may be
referred. When the children read about
the oriole or the robin, he is compared
with the canary, and the old lesson explains
and reënforces the new. The
value of such lessons depends upon the
teacher’s recognition of this relation.
The children need not know the skeleton
of her plan, but she must know the
end from the beginning.</p>

<h3>II.—<i>Study of “The Builders”—Longfellow.</i></h3>

<h4>PREPARATION FOR THE POEM.</h4>

<p>If the readers are young children, it
would be well to prepare for the reading
of the poem by a lesson upon the material
building. It is possible that the carpenters
and masons are already at work
in the immediate neighborhood of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
schoolhouse. The children have been
interested in watching the digging of
the cellar, the laying of the foundation
stone, the fixing of the frame in position,
the building of the walls. A little
questioning and observation will lead
them to see how necessary it is to the
strength of the building that every part
be well shaped and firmly placed. There
may be unfortunate examples in their
neighborhood which show the folly of
dishonest building. They may easily be
led to realize what harm may result from
slighting any piece of work, or falsely
covering any weakness. Anecdotes are
abundant to illustrate this: the bridge
which gives way beneath the weight of
the passing train, carrying hundreds to
death; the dam which has weak timber,
yielding to the pressure of the freshet;
the elevator which falls with its precious
load. These point to building which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
was insecure and treacherous. For the
other side of the picture, we turn to the
old cathedrals, showing the children the
beautiful spires, the exquisite carving,
and telling them how they have endured
through the ages because their builders
did honest work.</p>

<p>Such a lesson prepares for the interpretation
of the poem, which turns our
thought to the building which we are
shaping with our to-days and yesterdays.
The lesson of the unstable wall,
the falling bridge, as well as the grace
and strength of the cathedral, serve now
as a parallel for the poet’s teaching, and
the inevitable result to others is seen as
well as felt when we read of the “broken
stairways, where the feet stumble as they
seek to climb.” After such lessons,
every line is filled with meaning as the
children read and re-read the inspiring
poem. Then it is time to memorize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
every line, but especially the two stanzas,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“In the elder days of art,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Builders wrought with greatest care</div>
<div class="verse">Each minute and unseen part;</div>
<div class="verse indent1">For the gods see everywhere.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Let us do our work as well,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Both the unseen and the seen:</div>
<div class="verse">Make the house, where gods may dwell,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Beautiful, entire, and clean.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is not necessary to preach while
teaching this poem. The lesson impresses
itself upon the children if they
are rightly prepared for it. They will
make their own application, but we
should not forget that a valuable lesson
like this is not measured by ease in
recitation or accuracy in reading. If in
the days to come the memory of the
poet’s words gives strength in the hour
of temptation, or incites to honest work
when the hand inclines to careless shirking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the lesson will have counted for
good. In selecting our poems for our
children, and in directing their reading,
such hope should guide our choice.
The words of the poem or story will
recur again and again when the memory
of the school-room has faded. We
should be assured that the minds of our
pupils are furnished with thoughts worth
remembering. “Whatsoever things are
lovely, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever
things are of good report, if there
be any virtue, and if there be any praise,
think on these things.”</p>

<p>The poem selected for this lesson is
suitable for use in third, fourth, or fifth
grades, although even younger children
enjoy hearing it read. Such children
would, however, find difficulty in a detailed
study, such as is suggested in this
exercise. The poem may be used simply
as a reading lesson, or it may be
read, studied, and memorized by the
pupils as a language exercise. The various
advantages of the study are indicated
in the following suggestions, which
are intended to indicate merely some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the different modes of treatment which
may be attempted in language teaching.</p>

<h4>THE THOUGHT IN THE POEM.</h4>

<p>As in all lessons, the children should
read the entire poem, or hear it read,
before any detailed study is attempted.
This is done in order that the poem may
be presented to them as a whole, giving
its thought or telling its message. After
such reading, every verse and word will
assume its rightful place in the description
of the story. Otherwise, given
separately, the words lose the meaning
which they are intended to convey. A
poem, like a picture, should be presented
as a whole, and never dissected, in the
first lesson.</p>

<p>It is wise, sometimes, to read and to
re-read without note or comment; then
to lay aside the book and leave the children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
to recall the story, and to accustom
themselves to its pictures. At the next
lesson, the teacher may question, following
out any of the suggested lines of
work.</p>

<p>The important motive is to get the
message which the author intended to
give us in the poem. Everything else
must be subordinate to this purpose.
Any supplementary teaching which
draws the attention away from the
poem, creating a separate centre of interest,
is excessive. All illustration and
explanation should be intended simply
to throw light upon the poem, making
the pictures more vivid and the message
more plain.</p>

<p>The thought in this poem is very evident,
even to the children. In the first
stanza the blackbird on the beechwood
spray introduces us to the pretty maid,
“slow wandering” his way. She is little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Bell. Sitting down beneath the rocks,
she asks the blackbird for his best song.
The bonny bird pours his full heart out
freely, while, in the little childish heart
below, all the sweetness seems to grow
and grow, and shine forth in happy overflow
from the blue, bright eyes. The
squirrel swings and leaps and frolics in
the glade, and at the child’s bidding
drops down great ripe nuts into her lap.
The blackbird pipes to see the fun. The
child shares her treasures with the squirrel
and the bird, and again the poet tells
us</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“In the little childish heart below</div>
<div class="verse">All the sweetness seemed to grow and grow,</div>
<div class="verse">And shine out in happy overflow</div>
<div class="verse indent2">From her blue, bright eyes.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When, at close of day, the child kneels
to pray beside her snow-white cot, an
angel pauses to hear, and asks what good
child prays so lovingly beside her bed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
The blackbird answers from the orchard
croft, “Bell, dear Bell!” “Whom
God’s creatures love, God doth bless
with angels’ care,” the angel murmured.
“Child, thy bed shall be folded safe
from harm. Love, deep and kind, shall
watch around, and leave good gifts behind,
little Bell, for thee.”</p>

<p>Even the little children sense the
meaning of the poem. They have already
learned that love wins love and
makes friends, and they feel it to be both
natural and just that the loving little
Bell shall be shielded from all harm, and
sheltered by loving thought. The elder
children may be reminded of Sidney
Lanier’s poem, “How Love Sought for
Hell,” failing to find it because wherever
his presence came there were kindness
and light. The little ones are reminded
that the mirror gives back smile
for smile, and frown for frown. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
hardly necessary to “point the moral
and adorn the tale.” The poet has repeated
in the self-same words the lines
which show how the child grew in sweetness
as she played so lovingly with her
woodland friends. For many classes it
would be enough to talk of the poem
until the children were possessed of this
thought, or rather this feeling, and then
leave it to do its own work. In this
case, however, the poem serves as a
text for the lesson, and we shall consider
other phases.</p>

<h4><i>The Pictures in the Poem.</i></h4>

<p>The poem takes us at once to the
woods where the blackbird pipes on the
beechwood spray. We see the rocks,
the dell, the glade, the trees, the hazel
shade, and are made acquainted with
the blackbird and the squirrel. Plainly,
the setting of the poem is clearest to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
those children who themselves have
played in the woods; who have heard
the blackbird sing, and have seen the
squirrel leap from bough to bough. The
beechwood spray, the hazel shade, the
dell, the glade, the fern, are already
familiar to such children, and need no
lesson to introduce them. But if the
tenement house, the narrow alley, the
brick walls, and the noisy street have
been the familiar surroundings of the
children, and if the country seems as far
away to them as Paradise, the poem is
written in a foreign tongue. With such
children, other lessons are necessary before
any such selection is read or memorized.
These lessons may not be given
at the time of the reading—far better
not; but they should precede the reading
in the teacher’s plan, and the young
reader should enter upon this lesson
equipped with some knowledge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
bird, the squirrel, and the woods. In
another chapter, something has been
said of the necessity of such teaching,
and of the way in which such lessons
may be conducted. The suggestion is
made here simply to emphasize this
truth: that observation of nature is essential
to the interpretation of literature.</p>

<h4><i>Study of the Vocabulary of the Poem.</i></h4>

<p>Although the pupils may be prepared
by their out-of-door experience to understand
the poem, they will, nevertheless,
be met by a new difficulty in the
reading. The language of literature differs
from that to which they have been
accustomed in conversation. The tendency
of our school readers and children’s
books is often to remove such
difficulties from the path of the children.
The lessons are expressed in words already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
familiar to the children, and in
colloquial forms. While this practice
renders the first lessons in reading easy,
it makes the entrance to literature difficult.
Many expressions are entirely
foreign to the child’s ear, and therefore
unintelligible, even when the story is attractive.
The poem which we are using
for illustration contains many words and
phrases which the children have not met
in their ordinary reading. These must
be explained and their meaning made
familiar to the children. “‘What’s your
name?’ <em>quoth</em> he”; “stop, and <em>straight
unfold</em>”; “<em>showery</em> curls of gold”;
“<em>gleaming</em> golden locks”; “<em>bonny</em> bird”;
“blackbird <em>piped</em>”; “<em>dell</em>”; “<em>glade</em>”;
“<em>hazel shade</em>”; “<em>void</em> of fear”;
“<em>hies</em>”; “<em>golden woodlights</em>”; “<em>adown</em>
the tree”; “<em>playmates twain</em>”; “<em>an
angel shape</em>”; “<em>crooned</em> the blackbird
in the <em>orchard croft</em>,” are some of these.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>It may not be necessary nor wise in
most classes to study all these expressions
minutely, but they should become
plain to the children so that they may
plainly speak the message of the poem,
and present no difficulty if met elsewhere.
So with the figurative expressions:
“The bird did pour his full heart
out freely”; “the sweetness did shine
forth in happy overflow”; “thy bed shall
be folded safe from harm”; “stop, and
straight unfold.”</p>

<p>There is no reason why the young
readers should not come to realize the
picture in these figurative expressions,
to compare their several words with the
figure which the poet has used, and to
begin to sense the difference between
the plain, straightforward speech and
the pictured verses of the poet. Such
study, however simple, will help the
children to some appreciation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
beauty of expression, which is one
charm of literature.</p>

<p>From what has been said, it will be
rightly judged that the poem affords a
basis of several lessons, all of value in
different directions. It may not be wise
to make a detailed and careful study of
every poem which is read or memorized
by the children, but some teaching in
the lines suggested is indispensable to
intelligent reading on the part of the
children. The phrases which are so
familiar to us often suggest a very curious
idea to the children. This interpretation
is shown when they draw pictures
to represent the scenes of the
poem. In a certain school, the teacher
read a story to the children containing
the expression, “his mother gave him
leave to go.” The child drew the mother
in the act of presenting a leaf to the
boy. “Fret-work,” said the boy who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
read “Sir Launfal” for the first time,
“fret-work is work that makes you
fret”; while the child who drew the picture
of the hare and the tortoise represented
a turtle and a boy with bushy
hair. Reference has been made elsewhere
to the kid on the roof of the
house which was pictured as a little boy;
and the writer remembers the pictures
which were drawn by children in illustration
of the above poem, representing the
angels with webbed feet. These items
are intended simply to suggest that the
child’s crude notion is often very different
from the meaning which the word or
phrase conveys to us. We should be
grateful for the frank question or the
crude remark which betrays the child’s
mistake, and should be careful to secure
such confidence and freedom in our
classes as will enable us to discover what
the children are really thinking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>After reading and discussing the poem,
the children may memorize it. At this
juncture it is wise for the teacher to
read it to the children again and again
in order that they may get some notion
of the proper reading. The children’s
recitation will incline to adopt the virtues
of the teacher’s reading; the faults
will be imitated, also.</p>

<p>If, after such study and such memorizing,
the words of the poem appear now
and then in the children’s conversation
or writing, let us rejoice; for this means
not simply that new words have been
added to the vocabulary, but that the
child has a new conception of beauty of
thought and speech.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE STUDY OF PICTURES</span></h2>

<p>Children delight in pictures.
Every child-lover knows how intently
and with what delight the baby’s
eyes gaze upon the pages of the beloved
picture book, long before the words
which describe the picture can be
spoken or even understood by the
young student. The childish chatter
is an attempt to express the delight in
the treasure and the thoughts suggested
by the picture.</p>

<p>As the child grows older, pictures continue
to be a source of pleasure. He
names the familiar objects, talks about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
them, asks questions about them. Thus
he unconsciously grows in the power to
see and to tell what he sees, taught by the
many willing helpers who turn the pages
of his book and interpret its pictures.</p>

<p>Many a new idea creeps into the child’s
mind by the path of the picture book.
Many an object which would be entirely
foreign to his experience otherwise, becomes
familiar through its pages. Every
new book put into his hands is first challenged
by him to discover whether it contains
pictures, and it is the pictures that
first excite his desire to learn to read the
story which they illustrate.</p>

<p>We cannot estimate the contribution
which such books make to both knowledge
and vocabulary. Most of us can
think of scenes which we know only
through their pictured semblances, yet
seem to know well. We can remember
our first glimpses of scenes that pictures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
had made familiar. How friendly,
how well known they seemed! How we
were <em>used</em> to them! Niagara, Westminster
Abbey, the Pyramids, the Alps, are
known to many of us only through pictures.
Are we entirely ignorant, then,
of their beauty or their grandeur? When
our eyes first look upon them, shall we
not greet them as already a part of our
possession?</p>

<p>We have been slow, in our school
work, to follow the teaching of children’s
experience. Although we have
always known and always recognized the
child’s interest in pictures, we have not
used them in the school-room to the extent
that they might have been used,
nor in such a manner as to yield the
greatest advantage.</p>

<p>The writer remembers a class of children
in whose hands were placed some
new readers beautifully illustrated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
full-page pictures. The new books,
which had just been brought into the
room, were given to the children with
the brief direction, “Turn to page 85 and
begin reading at the top of the page.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Theirs not to reason why,</div>
<div class="verse">Theirs not to make reply.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The obedient fingers turned to the
page indicated, and the curious eyes
were allowed no moment to linger over
the pages which tempted them with their
fascinating pictures. Yet here was the
“Delectable Land,” which might have
been opened to them to their lasting advantage.
Here the children’s interest
was assured, and no artificial incentive
needed to be presented.</p>

<p>Another class, under similar conditions,
had a different experience.</p>

<p>“Here are new books,” the teacher
said to the children. “You will enjoy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
reading these stories, I know. But you
will find pictures in them as well as
stories. Before we read let us look at
the pictures and enjoy them.”</p>

<p>The children eagerly opened the books.
They found, as a frontispiece, a copy of
Rosa Bonheur’s “Norman Sire.”</p>

<p>The children talked about the picture,
compared the horse with horses that they
knew, admired the noble head, the fine
eyes. As they turned the pages of their
books they found other pictures of animals,
“The Lions at Home” and “Coming
from the Fair.” Their comments
were free, their questions ready. Nobody
thought of the picture as a picture.
The conversation centred about lions
and horses only, and expressed the children’s
interest in animals.</p>

<p>It was the teacher who called the attention
of the children to the name written
underneath the first picture, “Rosa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Bonheur.” This, they inferred, must be
the name of the one who made the picture.</p>

<p>The teacher then explained that the
pictures in the book were copied from
photographs of the original pictures
which the artist painted. If the children
were to see the painting they would find it
colored and much larger than the copies.</p>

<p>Looking again and with a new interest
at the other pictures, the children discovered
the same name written below
them. “Did Rosa Bonheur paint this
picture, too?” “And this?” “Did she
paint any others?” “Does she paint
now?” These questions answered, the
children asked, “Who painted the picture
of the little girl tending the baby?”
“Is this the painter’s name under the
picture?” “Yes, Meyer von Bremen.
On this page you will find another picture
of his.” The children found the
picture of “The Pet Canary,” and talked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
earnestly about it. “I like that picture.
I wonder if this is the same little girl.”
“What queer chairs!” “What a funny
window!” “This girl has been knitting,
too.”</p>

<p>The teacher threw some light upon the
German interior, explaining that this was
a picture of a home in the country where
the artist lived. Then she questioned,
“What did Meyer von Bremen paint for
you?” “Children,” was the ready response.
“And what did Rosa Bonheur
paint?” “Animals,” came quite as
readily. “Do the pictures tell you anything
about the artists?” The children
hesitated. “You remember ‘The Children’s
Hour’?” suggested the teacher.
“You thought that Mr. Longfellow
wrote about children”—“Because he
loved children,” volunteered a child, as
the teacher paused. “I should think
Meyer von Bremen liked children, too,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
observed another, thoughtfully. “And
Rosa Bonheur must like animals,” added
a third.</p>

<p>They turned again to the pictures,
and decided, after some discussion, that
Rosa Bonheur not only loved animals,
but was able to make us love them better
by her painting.</p>

<p>The books were closed and carefully
put away till time could be given for the
reading, which the children now so earnestly
desired. The lesson had been a
simple one. To some casual observers
it might have seemed no lesson at all.
“Just looking at pictures!” But it
opened to the pupils a new line of
thought, and served to illuminate both
picture and text. When the children
read, the pictures, now made to interpret
the text, themselves became teachers.</p>

<p>Though seemingly incidental, the lesson
pointed toward such study of pictures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
as should obtain in every school.
One of the greatest pleasures of life is
the delight in art, the creations of minds
that enjoy the beautiful, and know how
to make the world beautiful for others.
We have learned to give to young children
the poems which the world treasures.
They commit these to memory.
They learn to sing the hymns which the
greatest of musicians have composed.
In poetry, in music, we have begun to
learn how to teach. But should we not
teach the children to know and to love
good pictures, as well as good poems
and good music?</p>

<p>In too many of our homes the picture
is a stranger. Such teaching as tends to
interest the children in the picture gallery
or the art museum opens another
avenue of pleasure and profit, adds one
more resource to the lives which must
often be hindered and bound. By all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
means, let us begin it, and learn how to
use the wealth of material which lies at
our hand.</p>

<p>In a Boston school the teacher has
established a loan collection of pictures.
The children have the privilege of keeping
for a week the framed pictures which
they choose to carry home. They learn
to enjoy the pictures, and, so to speak,
to read them. They look with new interest
at all other pictures which come
in their way, comparing them with the
ones they have come to know. They
visit the art museum and study the
original from which their pictures are
copied. Their lives are enriched by
such teaching, their minds are furnished
with pleasant memories, and their love
of the beautiful is set growing.</p>

<p>Such study has a legitimate place in
the school curriculum. Happily, it is
now emphasized in some degree in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Drawing. It should also appear in connection
with the Reading. The picture
is intended to throw light upon the lesson
which is illustrated. The children
should be taught to read the picture as
well as to read the story.</p>

<p>Geography, as it is presented in good
schools of the present day, well illustrates
the necessity. The picture is
often a photographic reproduction of
the mountain, the cascade, the geyser,
the surf. The text describes, as clearly
as words can describe, but the picture is
far more faithful. It brings the scene
before the eyes of the child, while words,
misapplied or misunderstood, often build
a wall between the pupil and the scene
which they attempt to portray. If the
children learn to see all that the picture
contains, they are helped in their study
of the text. It is the part of wisdom,
from the teacher’s point of view, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
make much of these aids, even if knowledge
getting is the one goal in sight. It
can hardly be doubted, however, that all
teachers will recognize the greater need
which is satisfied by such instruction.
To know and to love these things so well
worth knowing and loving is quite as
worthy of achievement as the mastery
of equations or the demonstration of a
theorem.</p>

<p>If the Drawing does not admit of the
teaching suggested, the Language Lesson,
ever hospitably inclined, may be
extended to include the study of the picture.
Every teacher knows best what
pictures she desires to present to her
class, but, from common experience, a
few inferences may be made.</p>

<p>Certainly the picture chosen for initial
study should be one whose subject is interesting
to the children, a picture which
represents action or suggests a story.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Such pictures are Schreyer’s “Imperial
Courier,” Meyer von Bremen’s “Little
Nurse,” Millet’s “Angelus,” Landseer’s
“Saved.” After the children have become
interested in the picture they will
wish to learn who painted it, just as they
desire to know about the poet, after they
have come to enjoy the poem. Then
they are ready to look at the reprints of
the other works of the artist, regardless
of subject, and to ask questions about
the artist and his works. So the interest
deepens and the study grows, following
this natural order.</p>

<p>Fortunately the abundance of cheap
good reprints, and the careful illustration
of text-books, place the means for
such study within the reach of every
teacher and pupil. It will not be long
before the picture will take its proper
place with the song and the poem as a
factor in elementary education.</p>

<span class="smaller">HINTS FOR READING LESSONS.</span></h2>

<h3><i>Words at the Head of the Lesson.</i></h3>

<p>It is not uncommon to find the lists of
words which precede or follow the
lessons of the so-called “regular reader”
used as the only basis of the study of the
lesson. This would be wise if the lists
enumerated the only or the chief obstacles
to the children’s understanding of
the lesson. But as a matter of fact,
they must vary greatly in value, sometimes
bearing no relation to the real
needs of the individual class. They are
prepared with the average child in mind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
but as some one has humorously said,
“The average child does not exist.”
They may prove very helpful to one
class, and of no possible use to another.</p>

<p>Examine any such list with reference
to your own class, or ask the children to
study the list with you. You find that
the first word is an old friend, the second
is made up of two known words, the
third is unfamiliar in both meaning and
form, the fourth presents a variation
from the ordinary rule of spelling, the
fifth and the sixth are easy to master or
are already well known.</p>

<p>After such a survey, the thoughtful
pupil will “study” the third and fourth
critically and carefully, the others having
been disposed of in the first reading.
Such an exercise is profitable, deserving
the name of study. The routine direction,
“Study the words at the head of
the lesson twenty times, and copy them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
five times,” leads to careless droning
over the page and ends in preventing
any intelligent study.</p>

<h3><i>Reading “Without the Book.”</i></h3>

<p>A visitor in a primary school was astonished
by the rapid and fluent reading
of a five-year-old who delivered “The
Story of a Dog” with remarkable ease
and precision. “May I see your book?”
the visitor asked. The little lad passed
the book to her with smiling consent.
“But,” she exclaimed, “there is nothing
here that you have read.” “Dear
me!” cried the child, looking at the picture,
“I got the wrong dog.”</p>

<p>The writer remembers a child who explained
with charming naïveté, “I can
read my reader all through without the
book.” Upon being tested, he proved
his statement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>The constant repetition of the pages
of the “regular reader” soon imparts
this fatal facility, which often completely
deceives the teacher. The ability
to repeat the story, word for word,
does not necessarily involve the power
to recognize the words on any page.
The children simply memorize the sentences
to which they have so often
listened, and are reciting by rote, not
reading.</p>

<p>Just here the new lesson written upon
the board, or the supplementary reading
book, is effective. The new arrangement
of familiar words demands
thoughtful attention, and serves therefore
as a test of skill. The teacher
should guard against the common tendency
to use a single lesson until it becomes
useless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Word Study apart from the Reading
Lesson.</i></h3>

<p>If the words which occur in the reading
lesson present such difficulty to the
children that their first efforts in reading
are seriously hindered, it is wise to make
the word study a separate exercise, preparing
for the so-called reading lesson.
This preparatory lesson, often called
“the development lesson,” should make
the pupils so familiar with the form of
the word that it at once suggests the
meaning. If the meaning itself is new,
there is need also of the explanatory or
illustrative lesson. It may be wise to
repeat the suggestion that the explanation
does not always explain, and that
special illustration is necessary in presenting
new ideas to the children. In
any case, however, the time taken for
“sounding” the word, or the necessity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
for explaining its meaning, is an interruption
to the reading as thought getting,
and should be reduced to the lowest
terms in the reading exercise. The better
plan, with classes of young children,
is to arrange a separate time for word
study, as a preliminary to individual
study of the lesson. Where it is possible
to secure the necessary time, the
order of the work might be as follows:</p>

<p>1. Class study of new words, with explanation
and illustration by the teacher
when necessary.</p>

<p>2. Individual study of the lesson at
desks, or “busy work” employing new
words.</p>

<p>3. Reading the lesson which has been
studied.</p>

<p>4. Supplementary reading, sight reading,
or review.</p>

<p>This plan is especially adapted to the
first year of school, where the time is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
largely given to language and reading.
In the class study phonics finds its proper
time and place. In the seat work children
make some application of the knowledge
just acquired. When the reading
exercise takes place, the time should be
given to reading, the attention being
held to the thought in the lesson.</p>

<h3><i>Supplementary and Sight Reading.</i></h3>

<p>The supplementary book is intended
to afford variety in practice for the
young readers, and to prevent the memorizing
process, with its hindrance to
reading. Its use depends upon circumstances.
It should sometimes be used
as is the “regular reader”: studied, read,
and re-read—that is, if it is worth re-reading.
It may be given to the pupils
for silent reading only, or for individual
reading when other work is done. Selected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
lessons from the supplementary
reading may alternate with those of the
more familiar book, or the books may
be changed from week to week.</p>

<p>In “sight reading,” so called, the book
serves simply as a test of the pupil’s
power to read at sight, without definite
preparation in the way of study. Such
exercises should, of course, present no
new difficulty which demands study.
As soon as this becomes necessary, the
character of the exercise is changed, and
it becomes a “study of a lesson” instead
of a test or review. The teacher should
select, for sight reading, material of a
simpler sort than that which is demanded
in the current exercises in reading at that
period. Second Grade classes may read
First Readers. Third Grade classes may
use Second Readers, and so on.</p>

<p>Of course this provision becomes useless
as soon as the pupils have passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the “learning to read” stage, and are
reading for the sake of thought getting
only, without reference to training in
power to read. Then the supplementary
books should be chosen purely with
an eye to throwing light on other subjects
studied, or for their literary value,
and pleasure in reading. Mention has
been made elsewhere of the value of
school libraries as an aid to the reading
habit. Here the Supplementary Reader
loses its title, and advances to the grade
of a “real book.” Now the cultivation
of the reading habit and the love of
books is an immediate aim, and the book
ceases to serve as a test merely. It is
a means to an end, an instrument by
whose use new knowledge can be gained
or the pleasure of life enhanced. Therefore
it is wise to spend carefully the
money devoted to books, buying few
of a kind, and many kinds now. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
reference, for individual reading, for
reading to the class, this collection of
books is invaluable. The skilful teacher
will plan many exercises which will reach
far beyond the immediate lesson in their
beneficent results.</p>

<h3><i>Reading Poetry.</i></h3>

<p>Among the many school-room exercises
which yield present profit, none
other continues its dividends so far into
the future as does the intelligent reading
and memorizing of a good poem. It has
been urged elsewhere that the teacher
should frequently read good poetry to
the children, often without comment, but
sometimes repeating the reading again
and again, until the children become
familiar with the rhythm, question the
meaning, and are ready to memorize the
poem. Such exercises are immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
helpful in other reading, while they store
the sturdy young memory with treasures,
promising enjoyment for future years,
which can be gained in no other way.
Childhood is the one fit season for amassing
such wealth. It is well for the children
if the teacher recognizes this opportunity.
Just here it may be wise to
refer to the interest which attends such
exercises in schools where every class
chooses a class poet, reading and memorizing
selections from his works, and
learning something about his life. From
the lowest to the highest grade this work
proves helpful, and the children’s association
with these authors is never forgotten.
Something the memory will hold,
do what we may. Let us supply materials
worthy to endure, preventing the
accumulation of stuff which is not merely
of indifferent value, but is often positively
harmful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Friday Afternoons.</i></h3>

<p>The old custom of setting aside a part
of Friday afternoons for declamation and
recitations is remembered with mingled
feelings by the pupils who shared its
advantages. Nevertheless the custom
should be perpetuated, for such exercises
afford an unusual opportunity for
practice in reading and reciting for the
sake of others. To read aloud so that
our hearers can listen with pleasure,
gives us the power and privilege of helping
and pleasing others. No life is without
such opportunities. It is wise to
emphasize this accomplishment in our
schools, and to expect our pupils to become
competent to render this service.</p>

<p>Any exercise which accustoms the children
to reading or reciting with ease,
modesty, and simplicity, in the presence
of, and for the sake of, others, adds materially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
to their ability to make themselves
agreeable as well as useful.</p>

<p>The special exercise, when one class
entertains another class in the hall, or
when children recite for the audience of
schoolmates and parents, differs from the
ordinary exercise in motive. Why should
one read plainly when everyone else
holds a similar book and is reading the
same paragraph? But to read to those
who have no book, have never read the
story, or really desire to hear it, that is
another matter.</p>

<p>So, with no artificial manner, voice,
or gesture, but with a pure and simple
desire to please, let the children read
and recite to one another, or to other
classes, at least once a week, until the
exercise becomes as natural as breathing.
And let the power to thus minister to
others become one of the common attainments
of our pupils.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Children as Teachers.</i></h3>

<p>The child’s interpretation of that
which he reads is often very different
from the teacher’s. Yet his rendering
does not always disclose his thought.
Conversation regarding the lesson brings
out the children’s notions, if there is
freedom and confidence in the presence
of the teacher. But nothing else affords
so much light on the subject as the children’s
own questions, if they are allowed
to question one another. Where the
teacher monopolizes the questions, she
often monopolizes the thinking, too.
Let the children act the part of the
teacher, and as they question one another,
their own ideas will appear, while
the teacher who listens thoughtfully will
be able to teach according to the revelation
which she hears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Management of the Reading Class.</i></h3>

<p>The abandonment of concert reading
at once necessitates the reorganization
of the reading class. “If I cannot have
my children read in concert,” one questions,
“how can I keep them interested
and attentive through the long reading
hour?”</p>

<p>The way of escape from the difficulty
is a simple one. Do not expect to arrange
to have fifty pupils read at one
period, unless there is some work worth
doing to demand their attention. The
plan of work will vary with the grade of
the class and the aim of the lesson.</p>

<p>Is the teacher’s purpose to introduce
the class to the lesson thought? To
teach them how to study the lesson?
To discover what words or phrases or
turns of expression present obstacles to
the learners? Then fifty may be taught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
and questioned as well as one, and just
as long as general interest and attention
can be maintained—no longer.</p>

<p>Is the aim of the teacher to afford
practice in oral reading, by drilling upon
the rendering of a certain paragraph?
Then let her limit the class to ten or
twelve at most, leaving the other pupils
to busy themselves with written work
which admits of definite accomplishment.
All pupils become weary of the
countless repetitions of their mates, in
their stumbling practice. They learn
chiefly through their own doing, the
correction of their own mistakes. And
while the drill is confined to the few,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Satan finds some mischief still</div>
<div class="verse">For idle <em>minds</em> to do.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So the old hymn might be varied by
the experienced teacher who remembers
unnumbered cases of discipline which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
have arisen from the monotonous drill
exercises in which the wits of the majority
of the class were unemployed. By
all means, in such cases, drill a few pupils
at a time, and let the others be profitably
employed in conscious endeavor
to accomplish something.</p>

<p>In older classes where the reading has
passed the elementary stage, and the
pupils are reading for information or enjoyment,
neither length of lesson nor
number of pupils need be considered.
Here, without doubt, the interest in the
subject will be paramount, and “method”
may be forgotten. Now the children
read for the love of reading, and
the only gauge of time or number is the
teacher’s power to interest her class.
The one aim is to get the message from
the book, and to make it plain to those
who hear. Desire is the spur to endeavor,
and attention is at the command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
of interest. The teacher’s one secret
is the art of making her pupils book
lovers.</p>

<h3><i>Concert Reading.</i></h3>

<p>To save time, in the hurried day with
its crowded program, is the teacher’s
constant desire, and it is not remarkable
that, under pressure, achievement
is measured by counting the minutes
of recitation and numbering the facts
learned or the questions answered. It
is a common error to assume that mere
lip repetition is valuable drill, and that
“practice makes perfect,” even when
the practice is indifferent or unwise.
Quantity is carefully measured, while
quality is ignored, in such drill.</p>

<p>To this mistaken estimate the wide prevalence
of concert recitation is due. If
thirty children read at one time, it would
seem that the recitation accomplishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
thirty times as much as would be accomplished
by a single recitation in the same
time. “I could not get through with
the lesson,” explains the teacher, “if I
did not have my class read in concert.”</p>

<p>The theory appears plausible to the
mathematical mind. Upon inspection,
however, its failings appear.</p>

<p>In what does the value of the lesson
as a reading lesson consist? The exercise
should aid the children in getting
the thought or in expressing it fluently
and naturally. The teacher should be
assured that the mind of every reader is
intelligently active in the thought getting,
and that the practice in expression
is such as will lead to independent
skill.</p>

<p>But observe: in concert reading the
individual difficulties are “skipped.”
While John, who fails to recognize a
word, falters, hesitates, and halts, Jane,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
to whom it is an old friend, marches triumphantly
on. John takes breath, and
plunges in again when his stumbling-blocks
have been safely passed (by his
comrades). John’s achievement was
<em>nil</em>, likewise Jane’s, for she knew the
word before. As a teaching exercise,
then, the concert reading is ineffective.
It is safe to assume that it is difficult if
not impossible for any teacher to know
that all of her pupils are really reading
all the time during the concert exercise,
or that a seemingly good concert exercise
really proves that all the members
of the class can master, or have mastered,
the lesson.</p>

<p>Again, as a practice in expression the
concert exercise is harmful, because it
ignores the individual expression and
aims at an average movement, inflection,
interpretation. The product is
not the expression of the thought as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
appears to John, Jane, or Henry, but
a composite which represents nobody.
The sprightly Kate must wait for the
ponderous Phœbe; the slow-moving
James must lag behind the animated
Jack. Let a dozen teachers attempt to
read aloud in concert, without previous
common training, and the statement
will need no further argument.</p>

<p>To the writer the time given to concert
reading in the elementary schools
seems ill-spent. Definite teaching and
practice are possible only when the pupils
are considered as individuals. Droning
and indifference are cultivated by the
concert exercise.</p>

<p>The above statements apply to all exercises
whose object is to teach reading.
Declamation or recitation of the poem
or paragraph which has been studied,
read, and mastered by the individuals of
the class, or which presents merely an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
imitation of the teacher’s reading, is
included under another head. It deals
with known material, and presupposes
training which leads to a common interpretation.
Such recitation partakes
of the nature of song, and here the
power to render the thought in unison
becomes an element of value. For
such exercises special training should be
given.</p>

<p>In schools where it is possible for the
classes to meet in the hall for morning
exercises, or even in preparation for the
devotional exercises of any single class,
such training is indispensable. To know
how to read in responsive exercises, to
join with others in the rendition of a
favorite psalm, hymn, or other poem, is
no trivial acquisition. It is worth while
to include in our reading exercises such
lessons as will develop this power. Does
the ordinary concert exercise do this?</p>

omitting the individual recitation. Individual

precede any exercise in concert reading.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In my garden I spend my days, in my
library I spend my nights. My interests are
divided between my geraniums and my books.
With the flowers I am in the present; with
the books I am in the past. I go into my
library and all history unrolls before me. I
breathe the morning air of the world while
the scent of Eden’s roses yet lingered in it,
while it vibrated only to the world’s first
brood of nightingales and to the laugh of
Eve.</p>

<p>I see the pyramids building; I hear the
shoutings of the armies of Alexander; I feel
the ground shake beneath the march of Cambyses.
I sit as in a theatre; the stage is
Time, the play is the World. What a spectacle
it is! What kingly pomp, what processions,
file past; what cities burn to heaven,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
what crowds of captives are carried at the
chariot wheels of conquerors! I hear or cry,
“Bravo!” when the great actors come on,
shaking the stage. I am a Roman emperor
when I look at a Roman coin. I lift old
Homer, and I shout Achilles in the trenches.
The silence of the empeopled Syrian plains,
the outcomings and ingoings of the patriarchs,
Abraham and Ishmael, Isaac in the
fields at eventide, Rebekah at the well, Jacob’s
guile, Esau’s face reddened by the desert
sunheat, Joseph’s splendid funeral procession—all
these things I find within the
boards of my Old Testament.</p>

<p>What a silence in those old books, as of a
half-peopled world; what bleating of flocks,
what green pastoral rest, what indubitable
human existence! Across brawling centuries
of blood and war I hear the bleating of Abraham’s
flocks, the tinkling of the bells of Rebekah’s
camels.</p>

<p>Oh, men and women, so far separated yet so
near, so strange yet so well known, by what
miraculous power do I know you all? Books
are the true Elysian fields where the spirits
of the dead converse, and into these fields a
mortal may venture unappalled. What king’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>

of philosophy such wisdom?</p>

<p>There is Pan’s pipe; there are the songs of
Apollo. Seated in my library at night, and
looking on the silent faces of my books, I am
occasionally visited by a strange sense of the
supernatural. They are not collections of
printed pages; they are ghosts. I take one
down, and it speaks with me in a tongue not
now heard on earth, and of men and things
of which it alone possesses the knowledge.</p>

<p>I call myself a solitary, but sometimes I
think I misapply the term. No man sees
more company than I do. I travel with
mightier cohorts around me than ever did
Timour or Genghis Khan on their fiery
marches. I am a sovereign in my library;
but it is the dead, not the living, that attend
my levees.</p>

<p>The Free Public Library is often
termed the People’s College. It
is established by communities that believe
education to be the foundation of
civic freedom as well as an element in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
human happiness. By taxation of the
people these treasures of books are made
free to all: the richest and the poorest
alike. Here one’s scanty library is reënforced
by full and rare collections,
and the entire care of the custodians is
to make this treasure-house useful to all
comers.</p>

<p>But the reports of the librarians, encouraging
though they be, do not describe
a state of general reading. A
study of these reports will reveal the
fact that only a small part of the ought-to-be
reading public finds its way to the
library and uses this marvellous opportunity.</p>

<p>If we question why the readers are so
few, we shall doubtless arrive at certain
conclusions. Aside from the duties and
necessities which debar many would-be
readers from using the library, we shall
conclude that the majority of persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
not illiterate who fail to avail themselves
of this opportunity have not learned to
love books; while many others who have
had considerable reading in school or at
home have not learned how to make the
stores of the library available.</p>

<p>Enough has been said, perhaps, regarding
the necessity of teaching children
to love books, to the end that they
may have wholesome interests and simple
and natural pleasures. Books reveal
the experience of others, and yield to us
the companionship of the wise and good.
Sympathetic observation of the lives of
boys and girls who have not been trained
to this larger interest would drive us to
renewed endeavors to open wide the
doors to them, out of and away from
the temptations which allure them to
lower loves. The life that does not
know how to find pleasure in a book,
that turns to the saloon rather than to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
the library, is sad indeed. We cannot
urge too strongly the early and continual
teaching whose object is to make the
children book-lovers.</p>

<p>But, if the young book-lover appears
at the library door and fails to find the
clue to the labyrinth where the words
which he desires may be found, he may
wander away again, never to return. If
his love is strong, and the custodian
learns his need, he may study his way
into the desired paths; but it is evident
to all readers that the library is most
available to the best prepared, and that
the vast treasures of even the free library
are worthless to the ignorant. Further,
we can but recognize that home reading
and school reading do not always qualify
the reader for study in a library. He
must be taught how to use it, and somebody
must teach him.</p>

<p>Home and school must supply this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
need. The wise father and mother will
go with the children to the library, and
there teach them to use books; while in
school, the teacher of reading will aim
beyond the simple mastery of the text-book.
No longer can she content herself
with guiding her pupils through the
Fifth Reader from page 1 to page 256.
With her larger conception of reading,
she knows now that her pupils must be
taught to unlock other books, and she
sets herself to teach them how to do
this.</p>

<p>But <em>how</em>?—a practical question. This
chapter would avail little did it fail to
attempt an answer.</p>

<p>First, by including in her teaching
such lessons as will show the use of
books as tools. The student who hunts
down a subject in the library looks
through myriads of books, but he does
not read them all. He learns first what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
books are likely to answer his question.
All other books he excludes from his
list. He learns further where to look
for aid in his selected books, and turns
at once to the helpful pages, excluding
all others. So he reaches the chapter,
the page, the line which contains the
desired message, and achieves his end.
The untrained worker loses himself in
the labyrinth of books, and finds nothing.</p>

<p>Such ability to use books is not a gift;
it is earned by thoughtful practice. The
power to use reference books comes only
through wisely using them. The art begins
with the use of the dictionary and
the supplementary reader, and here
should the teacher first apply herself to
teach the use of books of reference.</p>

<p>First, as to the dictionary. All grammar-school
classes should be supplied
with a good unabridged dictionary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
while every pupil should have access to
a smaller one, and be taught to use it
so constantly that he will consider it an
equal necessity with his pocket-knife.
Where children buy their own books,
the possession of the dictionary should
be urged. Ownership is equally desirable
where books are supplied by the city
or town. Nothing can take the place of
it. The dictionary is the student’s commonest
tool.</p>

<p>Having dictionaries, the children
should be taught to use them. Here
they are. What are they? What do
they contain? What are they good
for? Of what use can they be to you?</p>

<p>A study of the book reveals to us that
the dictionary tells us the meaning of unfamiliar
words; it may therefore help to
explain to us what we read. Or it gives
us many meanings of words, in their
various uses, thus helping us to choose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the fitting one. Again, it shows us the
correct spelling and pronunciation of the
words which we need to use in reading
or speaking; while in our later study it
reveals to us the grammatical uses of
words, giving good authority for each
use, and further explains the derivation
or tells the history of the word.</p>

<p>Before leaving the grammar school,
children should be able to gather all this
help from the dictionary. In the lower
grades—fourth and fifth—the lessons
will be confined to the study of the dictionary
as a means of learning the meaning,
spelling, and correct pronunciation
of the selected words.</p>

<p>The first step is a study of the arrangement
of the book: the title, introduction,
preface, keys to pronunciation,
rules for spelling; then the lists of words,
arranged in alphabetical order. What
does that mean? Who knows the meaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
of the order of the letters of the alphabet?
Test the class to discover this.
Often the first lack appears here. By
rapid recitation both forward and backward,
and varied questions, make this
knowledge available here. “Does S
come before or after M, U, G, Q, W?
In which half of the alphabet shall I find
N, L, F, T? etc. I am turning the leaves
of the dictionary to find the word ‘Travel.’
I open to a page of words beginning
with M. Shall I turn forward or
backward?” By such tests oft repeated,
dictionary in hand, the children accustom
themselves to the alphabetical order.
Do not forget that it must be taught.
It is not discovered by intuition.</p>

<p>After tracing the word to its letter, it
remains to be found upon the page—a
more difficult study of alphabetical arrangement.
The child who attempts to
find the word “Travel” finds the Ta’s,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
but, with his limited knowledge, stays
to rest his eyes upon Table, Tack, Tall,
Tank, etc., in his likely-to-be-vain
search. Now he must study with his
teacher the fuller detail of alphabetical
order. The word to be found begins
with Tr. Let him leave Ta, Te, Ti to
find Tr, and then must he follow on
with his finger to Trav; and now slowly
through this column to the appointed
word.</p>

<p>The order being thus made clear, a
double practice should be given, to fix
it in his mind: first, finding chosen
words in the dictionary in the quickest
possible time; second, making lists of
words in alphabetical order.</p>

<p>These lessons may seem superfluously
simple and mechanical, but it is due to
the omission of such teaching that so
many hours are wasted in the blind
search after the contents of books, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
that so many dictionaries are fresh-edged,
unused.</p>

<p>Thus far the pupil has simply found
the way to his word. Now he must
learn to read what the dictionary tells
him about it. Here further knowledge
is required.</p>

<p>He finds the word so divided and
marked as to enable him to pronounce
it correctly, if he knows enough. But
first he must know how to pronounce
the syllables into which it is divided,
and to translate the marks used for his
benefit. Syllabification and diacritical
marks constitute the subject of the next
series of lessons.</p>

<p>The first is not so minor a matter as
it may seem at first sight. Proper division
into syllables is necessary to proper
pronunciation of syllables, and a correct
naming of the consecutive syllables
means correct pronunciation of the word.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
The children’s trick, which often confounds
the scholar, proves this. “Pronounce
ba-cka-che,” they demand, dictating
the syllables as written. After
sufficiently enjoying the scholar’s discomfiture,
they pronounce the common
word, backache. It is no more than
fair to give him a taste of their daily
vicissitudes. All teachers know how
children are daily lost in the mazes of
syllabification. It would be well to
avert this evil, and lead to a more helpful
reading of the dictionary, by giving
lessons whose object is the mastery of
syllables. Separating familiar words
into their syllables and pronouncing by
syllable at sight are excellent exercises,
and they may well displace some of the
formal and mechanical study of never-to-be-used
lists of words.</p>

<p>Many words are mastered for all time
as soon as the art of syllabification is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
learned. For others there remains, however,
the need of the diacritical marks.</p>

<p>As teachers know (but as children seldom
discover), those marks exist simply
as aids to pronunciation. They vary, in
different dictionaries. It is, therefore,
necessary that children should study the
key to pronunciation in the dictionary
which they use. As an aid to their
memories, an epitome of this key is
printed at the bottom of every page,
that he who runs may read. If the
mark is not recognized, a glance shows
them the value of the same marked
vowel in a familiar word. The sound
of the unfamiliar word is made plain to
them if they have learned to read the
dictionary. Drill in pronouncing columns
of the words found in the dictionary,
is an aid to the rapid acquirement
of power to translate these equivalents,
while, until this power is won, the pupil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
may be helped by marking familiar
words in accordance with the key.</p>

<p>The mastery of the alphabetical arrangement
and syllabification and pronunciation
being assured, there remains
the study of the grouped meanings and
the derivation, with attention to grammatical
use. As soon as the pupil knows
the parts of speech, the various uses of
words are made plain to him, and he intelligently
follows the dictionary column
which exhibits a word as noun, verb, adjective,
or adverb. If his object is to
discover the verb meaning, he passes the
others. If the earlier and perhaps obsolete
meanings do not apply, he reads on
until the fitting definition is reached. If
the definition itself is not plain to him,
he “looks up” the unfamiliar words contained
in it. But he keeps at work until
he has made himself master of the word
for whose meaning he sought. Quotations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
showing standard use are read and
considered. The paragraph or sentence
containing the new word is re-read, illumined
by the new meaning.</p>

<p>Such a lesson has in it the virtue of
a language lesson. The new word, with
its precious cargo, has become the child’s
possession, and he can send it voyaging
to ports he desires to reach with his
thought. Further, through such exercises,
he learns to master books.</p>

<p>The more mature student will carefully
con the root-meaning, and follow
the word through its devious history.
That work, in its detail, must wait for
the higher grades and the college. But
with such thoroughness as has been outlined,
the grammar grade pupil may
make the dictionary his strong ally and
unfailing friend. It behooves us to teach
him the art.</p>

<p>Books of reference should be made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
available to the pupils, as is the dictionary,
by lessons which show their use.
The Atlas, the Cyclopedia, the Compendium,
should be explained, and opportunities
for their use should be created.
So all minor books—grammars, histories,
geographies—should be consulted by the
children, and compared with their own.
In such consultation the index or table
of contents should serve its purpose.
The pupil should not be allowed to
search the book from cover to cover for
his bit of information, but should be
taught to look for it, by the help of the
index, in its proper place, just as he
learned to find the word on the page of
a dictionary. Through such study, children
may develop the habit of turning
to books for information and enlightenment.
They will know how to seek
and find. We cannot overestimate
easily the value of such a habit and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
accompanying tendencies in their after
life.</p>

<p>We have spoken thus far of the child’s
use of single books under the direction
of the teacher. A few words further in
regard to the school library, which
should be an introduction to the Public
Library.</p>

<p>In these days many schools are provided
with the nucleus of a library.
Every school should have one. A few
shelves of books, well chosen and well
used—these are next in importance to the
teacher in the equipment of a school.
By properly using such books, the children
learn how to choose and to use
their own books when they get them,
and meanwhile how best to avail themselves
of the Public Library.</p>

<p>In order to afford enough practice in
finding what is in the books which are
within reach, the teacher should assign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
to the pupils work which will necessitate
the use of these books. The reading
lesson speaks of the cultivation of
cotton. Ask John or Joseph to learn
whether any book in the library throws
light on the cultivation or manufacture
of cotton. The boy first makes up
his mind what books will be likely to
contain this information, and then, by
use of the indexes in the chosen books,
discovers his item, which he brings as
his contribution to the class. What he
learns about cotton is of far less value to
him than what he gains through searching
for the item. Again, the history lesson
treats of the war for independence.
The teacher, instead of confining the
pupils to memorizing the work on the
pages of the school history, sends them
to the bookshelves to consult the English
histories which shall tell the children
something of George III. and the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
statesmen of his time. By and by
they have gained not only some facility
in the use of books, but the knowledge
that some books are of greater use than
others in the lines of their study.</p>

<p>It is but a step, now, from the school
library to the Public Library, and this
step should be taken when the children
feel the limitations of their bookshelves.
Their quest must take its beginning in
their need; not in the teacher’s advice,
but in their inclination. John cannot
find in any book in the school library
what he wants to know about William
Pitt. Very well. Does he know any
book that would give him the desired
information? There may be books at
the library, he volunteers. Ah, yes.
How can he find out? By going there.
Susan suggests that the library catalogue
will tell him whether he can find
there just what he wishes. And now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the school comes into possession of the
catalogue of the Free Public Library of
the town—owns it <em>because</em> the children
need to use it. John finds in the catalogue
the names of the books which he
thinks may contain the object of his
search. Here the teacher helps him by
pointing out, from her fuller knowledge,
the books which will be simple enough
to be of service to him. Or the custodian
of the library lends a hand, and
names the books which will be most
helpful.</p>

<p>We may readily see that here begins
another series of lessons which, unfortunately,
rarely makes its appearance.
Inside the library door, the youthful
seeker after light struggles to get the
book which he desires. He must learn
the machinery of the library, and somebody
must teach him. If the teacher
knows the librarian and the librarian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
knows the teacher, and both are interested
in the boy, we have a happy state
of affairs. His card is filled out for him
and properly signed. He is now allowed
to take books for himself. He must be
told where to get them and how to get
them; what to do with them when he
gets them; what to do if he cannot get
them; how, and when, and where to return
them; what privileges he may have
in the use of them. Well for the boy if
his two friends and co-laborers make it
worth while for him to use the library in
these early days! Ah, who shall tell us
how to correctly mark in per cents the
value of this boy’s acquisition, or the
worth of the teacher’s instruction?</p>

<p>In many of our cities, this coöperation
of the library and the school exists, and
proves its usefulness. Teachers are supplied
with teachers’ cards, allowing them
to take six books at a time and retain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
them for a long time. Classes are supplied
with books. Boxes of books are
carried from school to school. Duplicates
of much-desired books are secured
from the librarian. Children are taken
to the library by the teacher, and the
classes study on the spot the operation
of the system, and familiarize themselves
with its plan of action. Children are
sent from school to consult reference
books, to study the collections of photographs,
or the mural decorations in the
building. The Boston Public Library
affords an example, not only of stateliness
of building and beauty of decoration,
but of efficiency of the system by
which its recent librarian, Mr. Herbert L.
Putnam, did much to bring the library
within the reach of the school-children
throughout the city.</p>

<p>If we rightly estimate the value of this
tendency to read and this love of books,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
we shall be willing to subordinate some
of the formerly accepted work of the
schools to this essential tuition. Shall
we continue to spend money for our
public libraries? If so, let us insure the
return of our investment a hundredfold,
by fitting our children to make use of
the privileges which are thus afforded
them, and teaching them to know the
best books.</p>

<p>[In response to the requests made by many
different teachers, I have prepared a list of
books, stories, and poems which are suitable
for reading or reciting to children. In all
cases the selections have been tested with
numbers of children, often with numbers of
classes, and the list represents the thoughtful
experience of many and different teachers.
In choosing, however, the teacher must be
guided by her knowledge of her own children.
It is unwise to accept without question
the judgment of another, who may teach
under conditions very different from those
which exist in the class of the seeker. Reference
to the list may, however, prevent fruitless
excursions to the library for unnecessary
reading of the books which would be read
only to be discarded. It will be safe to make
selections from the list for any class in the
public schools.—S. L. A.]</p>

<p><i>There is another view of reading, which,
though it is obvious enough, is seldom taken, I
imagine, or at least acted upon; and that is,
that in the course of our reading we should lay
up in our minds a store of goodly thoughts in
well-wrought words, which should be a living
treasure of knowledge always with us, and
from which, at various times and amidst all
the shifting of circumstances, we might be
sure of drawing some comfort, guidance, and
sympathy. … A man whose mind is enriched
with the best sayings of his own country
is a more independent man, walks the streets
in a town, or the lanes in the country, with far
more delight than he would otherwise, and is
taught by wise observers of man and nature to
observe for himself. Sancho Panza, with his
proverbs, is a great deal better than he would
have been without them; and I contend that a
man has something in himself to meet troubles
and difficulties, small or great, who has stored
in his mind some of the best things that have
been said about troubles and difficulties.</i></p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact</p>

<p>For additional contact information:</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
